He defeated Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist and euroskeptic, in the nation’s most consequential presidential election in decades.The final hours of the race were given a jolt when the campaign of Mr. Macron announced it had been hacked._____2. House Republicans celebrated a major victory last week with the passage of their health care bill, but it may be short-lived.The legislation, which would roll back the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, now moves to the Senate. Its future there is uncertain.House Republicans who voted for the bill could face a backlash in next year’s elections, especially if the measure’s potential to hurt the economy is realized. Above, protesters in Washington._____3. But right now, the economy is good. So good, in fact, that the U.S. is getting close to full employment.The latest numbers showed the jobless rate dropped to 4.4 percent, the lowest in more than 10 years.Wage growth, however, needs to be stronger to declare full employment, our economic reporter said._____4. It was a busy week for President Trump.On Friday, his second nominee to be secretary of the Army withdrew from consideration.Earlier in the week, he met with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, above, during his first trip back to New York as president.He also hosted the Palestinian leader at the White House, spoke with Russia’s president by phone and signed an order on religious liberty._____5.

Yates, above, the former acting attorney general, and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, are expected to testify.Also, the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested that a number of high-profile Trump campaign associates hand over records of their communications with Russians._____6. Issues of race and policing in the United States persist.

Slager pleaded guilty to charges that he violated Walter L. Scott’s civil rights in 2015, when the former officer shot and killed Mr. Scott.The Justice Department announced it would not bring charges against two Baton Rouge, La., officers involved in the fatal shooting of Alton B. Sterling._____7. Always Dreaming hoofed his way to a Kentucky Derby win on a soggy Saturday at Churchill Downs, landing his owners a $1,635,800 paycheck. Lookin at Lee finished second and Battle of Midway was third.It’s been two years since American Pharoah won the Kentucky Derby, kicking off a streak that led him to Triple Crown glory.These days, he’s a stud, making his owners up to $600,000 a day. Some of his foals have already been born._____8. Let’s take a moment to reflect on Rei Kawakubo, above, whose work was the centerpiece of New York’s biggest social night of the year: the Met Gala.Ms. Kawakubo was the first living designer to be given a solo show at the Costume Institute since 1983.She was an elusive presence at the ball last week, but her designs made a radical statement._____9. It was a simple plan. A college student in Kentucky would crawl through a building’s air duct in the wee hours to steal a copy of a final exam.But the student, and another one helping him, were caught in the act by the instructor. They’ve been charged with felony burglary.“It’s an unusual set of circumstances,” a University of Kentucky spokesman said. “It also underscores how late our faculty work.”_____10. Finally, let’s talk about love.One of the finalists in our Modern Love College Essay Contest wrote about how the cool girl persona she crafted on social media overtook her real-life personality, too.When she couldn’t break character to be more earnest in love, the man she was involved with moved on.
