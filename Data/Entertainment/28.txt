Dave Itzkoff and Jon Caramanica live-blogged the 71st annual Golden Globes on Sunday night, with contributions from Melena Ryzik and others.



11:36 P.M. That’s a Wrap
Hollywood Foreign Press Association voters spread the wealth at the Globes, anointing each of the front-runners with a little statuette or two — “American Hustle” earned the most, film-wise, with three, including best comedy. After shutting out “12 Years a Slave” in all the other categories, the voters still gave it the best drama prize.There is no overlap between the 80-some members of the foreign press group and the 6,000-plus Oscar voters, so there’s no direct link between Globes winners and eventual Oscar winners. In fact, the predictive power of the Globes seems to have waned as the Academy has monkeyed with the number of best picture nominees and other categories. But awards-watchers still pay attention; speeches, momentum and other winner behavior can help tip the scale for an Academy member who has yet to cast the ballot.At least, that’s normally the case. This year, the Oscar balloting for nominations has already closed. If anything, the wide assortment of winners suggests how difficult it will be for Academy members to narrow down their picks.— MELENA RYZIKLeonardo DiCaprio said “Wolf of Wall Street” was one of two films he was dedicated to bringing to the screen, even if they took years. The other was “The Aviator,” which Martin Scorsese also directed. But “Wolf” had a broader impact on Mr. DiCaprio.“After the economic crash, I said this level of hedonism needs to be reflected on screen,” he said.Making it, he added, was kind of like an “adrenaline dump” for him, especially as so much of it was improvised.
“On this film we knew we weren’t taking on previous American literature,” he said. “Plot was kind of irrelevant” for Mr. Scorsese.“I’m just thankful that Martin Scorsese is still this punk rock, still this vital at 71 years old,” he added.— MELENA RYZIKMatthew McConaughey’s catchphrase, “All right, all right, all right,” are the first words he ever spoke on the big screen, in the 1993 cult comedy “Dazed and Confused.” And they’ve served him well in the 20 years since, as he transformed from a stoner actor to a romantic comedy star to a character actor. He signed onto the part in “Dallas Buyers Club” by 2011 and held on as it went through the ups-and-downs of productions. It had been circulating Hollywood for years; at one point Brad Pitt was attached to star.— MELENA RYZIKDave Itzkoff: This was the beautiful mess we hoped it would be,” says co-host Tina Fey as the credits begin to roll. It was a messier show than I expected, even by Globes standards.
Jon Caramanica  And also one in which Amy and Tina were largely neutered, I thought. They were far less barbed than last year.
Dave Itzkoff Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were very solid, if not quite the revelations they were last year. But how many years in a row can you be a revelation?
Jon Caramanica Well Dave, we’ve been a revelation for, what, five years running now?
Dave Itzkoff They are saying on the Internet that “12 Years a Slave” is the first film with a black director to win a Golden Globe for best picture, so that has to count for something. The wins for “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” though not beloved by Jon Caramanica, were surprises too.
Jon Caramanica It really felt like a bait and switch, right? So much huffing and puffing during the course of the show about the middle finger extended to black film this year, and then at the end, “12 Years a Slave” was rewarded after all. If in looking back on this year’s awards we talk about the “breakout moment” for “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” we will have all lost.
Dave Itzkoff As I try to think back on the show, that’s about all I’ll remember — that and Liam Neeson’s deathless enunciation of the word “Gravity” — and we’ll find out on Thursday if any of this has any bearing whatsoever on the Oscar nominations. (The voting for which closed on Wednesday anyway.)
Jon Caramanica Maybe the real bait-and-switch was selling us a possible night of Amy and Tina razzing Hollywood and instead serving up a stream of largely obvious winners with obvious stars.
Dave Itzkoff Ah, but isn’t that what awards shows always are?
Jon Caramanica You would think I would know better by now.
Dave Itzkoff See you in two weeks for the Grammys, which we know will be surprising and sincere.
Jon Caramanica Really enjoying the Jennifer Lawrence press conference on E! right now, by the way. If she presents a Grammy to Macklemore, I might forgive him.Jon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff I was wrong earlier, and very glad to be, in anticipating that “12 Years a Slave” would be completely ignored tonight.
Jon Caramanica This is a shock, given how the rest of the night played out.
Dave Itzkoff Director Steve McQueen is up to accept the award for the film. “A little bit in shock,” he begins. “I wasn’t expecting this, please hit me with some of the names,” he continues, genuinely startled. He did get Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong’o in there, at least.
Jon Caramanica  And a very heartfelt thanks to Brad Pitt, who is the star of the “12 Years a Slave” foreign movie poster.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff  A very emotional performance by McConaughey in that film, capping nearly two straight years of worthy work. But I’m guessing that brings an end to any chances for “12 Years a Slave”?
Jon Caramanica I’m really glad Matthew McConaughey ended apartheid and escaped slavery to win this award.
Dave Itzkoff Of course he had to open with, “All right, all right, all right.”
Jon Caramanica Just keep livin’, Dave.
Dave Itzkoff It’s like I get older, and the Golden Globe nominees stay the same age. Yes, they do.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffDave Itzkoff  What the heck happened to the live feed? Was “supermodel’s vagina” a code word for the F.C.C. or something?
Jon Caramanica Yeah, that was odd.
Dave Itzkoff That field was nigh-impossible to call. Anyone of those nominees could have taken it, I suppose. Strange that “Blue Jasmine” would be deemed a drama when “Wolf of Wall Street” and “American Hustle” were considered comedies.
Jon Caramanica Especially because Cate Blanchett is workshopping her Laugh Factory set right now.
Dave Itzkoff Likely not the last time we see her up at the microphone this awards season, Jon. Get comfortable.
Jon Caramanica  Get a prescription is more like it.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff There’s 20 minutes left and only three awards — is no one allowed to give a speech longer than 10 seconds?
Jon Caramanica Apparently, the orchestra conductor is the only person who isn’t drunk there tonight.Dave ItzkoffJon Caramanica“The Wolf of Wall Street” has been notable for the voluble response from audiences as they argue about whether Martin Scorsese’s film glorifies a culture of amoral Wall Street greed. Best actor winner Leonardo DiCaprio has taken pains to defend the film.“It’s very polarizing,” he said recently, “but I think it’s good because it’s a commentary on the culture.”In Mr. DiCaprio’s view, the film is a cautionary tale against consumerism and profligate spending. It just happens to present that tale in an entertaining way. But if people think it’s a defense, he said, “I keep saying, they’re missing the boat.”— MELENA RYZIKDave Itzkoff Oh how I’d love to see David O. Russell give an acceptance speech at the Golden Globes — or any live-TV setting. But that’s producer Charles Roven accepting on behalf of the film.
Jon Caramanica Maybe he will Skype with us tomorrow?
Dave Itzkoff Ah, nothing like the reverse-angle to show the Teleprompter flashing, “Please Wrap Up.”
Jon Caramanica This is an official offer to David O. Russell to Skype with Jon & Dave, a new recurring feature on nytimes.com.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaAlfonso Cuarón’s win for best director for “Gravity”  is perhaps surprising — and not welcome — news for David O. Russell, whose “American Hustle” had a lot of love from Golden Globes voters going into the night, and scored performance wins for Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence. Mr. Russell lost both the screenplay award and the directing prize. Awards pundits will consider this as the films and filmmakers move forward on the prize circuit.— MELENA RYZIKIn the press room, Amy Adams, a Golden Globe winner for “American Hustle,” talked about how adept the director David O. Russell, whom she’s now worked with twice, is at creating female characters.“He wants to see the sort of sexual prowess of these characters but he also wants to see them at their most vulnerable and stripped down,” she said. “If you give him less than your soul, he will come like the devil” after it.— MELENA RYZIKDave Itzkoff This is DiCaprio’s first win at the Globes since “The Aviator” in 2005, I believe.
Jon Caramanica And his hair’s first appearance since a guest spot on “Boardwalk Empire” a couple of season back.
Dave Itzkoff A nine-time Globe nominee and a three-time Oscar nominee (to date). He thanks his fellow “comedians” Christian Bale, Joaquin Phoenix, Oscar Isaac and Bruce Dern — a testament to the fine line between comedy and drama in this year’s films. But even Leo DiCaprio gets played off at the Globes.
Jon Caramanica DiCaprio is practically in Bob Costas mode. He knows more about the other films than the HFPA voters.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaJon Caramanica Actually, I choose to see the victory of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” in this category as a joke about earpieces.
Dave Itzkoff Another big win for the rookie show. Andy Samberg (who’s not accepting the award this time) seems even more surprised than his previous trip to the stage.
Jon Caramanica I’m all for anything that gives Andre Braugher an ounce of recognition, but this is lunacy.
Dave Itzkoff What about Stephanie Beatriz’s glasses, huh?
Jon Caramanica They just got a 3-picture deal. Honestly feel “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” is getting all the awards “Parks & Recreation” was snubbed for.
Dave Itzkoff It’s only the Golden Globes, Jon. At least they saw fit to give Amy Poehler a trophy.Jon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffDave Itzkoff “This is for the hundreds of people that made this film possible. Because of my thick accent, they end up doing what they thought I’d said, not what I really said,” says winner Alfonso Cuarón.
Jon Caramanica So we’ve gotten acceptance speech jokes about Brazilian waxing and herpes so far, and Michael Douglas was on good behavior.
Dave Itzkoff You could see it as a joke about ear pieces, really.
Jon Caramanica Maybe you could, man. Maybe you could.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaA mild surprise in the foreign-language category, with Italy’s “The Great Beauty” winning out over “Blue Is the Warmest Color” from France. “Blue” had been considered a sentimental favorite of sorts, because it was ineligible for the Oscar and also because it pushes the envelope on explicit sex scenes. “The Great Beauty” is very much in the Oscar hunt, and with this win looks like an even stronger contender for the big prize.— LARRY ROHTERJon Caramanica Is there some subtext to having the Woody Allen retrospective at the same time everyone could be switching over to “Girls”?
Dave ItzkoffVery interesting that Emma Stone addressed her speech directly to Woody Allen, who most assuredly is not watching this or any other awards show.
Jon Caramanica “It’s safe to say that Woody Allen is an anomaly” — Diane Keaton coming perilously close to a subtweet there.
Dave Itzkoff Diane Keaton, however, hails Woody Allen for creating “the voices of four decades of unforgettable female characters,” including her Oscar-winning role in Annie Hall, up through Cate Blanchett’s performance in “Blue Jasmine.”
Jon Caramanica You can see the sweat beginning to bead on Diane Keaton, a bit.
Dave Itzkoff“Rather than live on in the hearts and minds of my fellow man, I would rather live on in my apartment,” Keaton quotes Allen as saying.
Jon Caramanica She’s speaking about him as if he’s on his deathbed — I found that uncomfortable!
Dave Itzkoff Well, I still prefer it to Jodie Foster’s speech from last year.
Jon Caramanica We are going to have to disagree on that, pal.Jon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaAnother opinion:Nite all— mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) 13 Jan 14Dave Itzkoff “Frozen” co-director Jennifer Lee gives a much deserved shout-out to the film’s husband-and-wife co-composers, Bobby Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. Bobby Lopez, of course, also a co-composer of the very un-Disney-musical “The Book of Mormon.” Amy Poehler, meanwhile, is understandably shaken up — she’s a three-time Globe nominee and six-time Emmy nominee, and has never won any of these awards before.
Jon Caramanica But apparently Bono rubbing your shoulders also rubs off some winner’s luck. Also given how Bono recoiled from Diddy’s hug earlier, it’s good to know he’s not phobic about touching other people.
Dave Itzkoff He certainly allowed Amy Poehler a thorough make-out session before she got to the stage. Perhaps a reference to earlier?
Jon Caramanica Or perhaps he had no choice! She did not appear to be taking no for an answer.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff So, the premise of this bit, Jimmy Fallon explains, is that Melissa McCarthy believes she is Matt Damon after having been hit on the head by a sandbag.
Jon Caramanica Written by Carson Daly’s writing team, it seems.
Dave Itzkoff Still a chance that Michael Douglas might get to make a live speech, hang in there Jon. Yes, here it comes.
Jon Caramanica Someone has their finger on the bleep button. Idris was robbed, by the way.
Dave Itzkoff  “The only reason you’re not here is because I had more sequins,” a very well behaved Douglas tells his “Behind the Candelabra” co-star Matt Damon. The real Damon, not Melissa McCarthy.
Jon Caramanica How many jokes do you think Michael Douglas workshopped to come up with one that was just on the edge of edgy but could pass for dull?Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaJon Caramanica ONLY SEVEN HOURS LEFT.
Dave Itzkoff I count 11 categories (including the Cecil B. DeMille). This is a hugely competitive category. “The Past” is also very strong contenders in this race. Very interesting if this portends anything for the Oscar race — perhaps “The Great Beauty” is the late bloomer here. Jon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffAn earlier version of this post referred to “Blue is the Warmest Color,” which isn’t eligible for the foreign language film Academy Award (France didn’t submit it).Emma Thompson has a vendetta against high heels. Before throwing them away onstage tonight, she doffed them at the National Board of Review gala when she accepted her award there for “Saving Mr. Banks” last week, as a “feminist statement.” She also took them off as she ran down the red carpet entering the Globes.— MELENA RYZIKDave Itzkoff Big win for Andy Samberg in his rookie year. I have this sneaking suspicion that Seth Meyers had his thumb on the scale for him.
Jon Caramanica  I have this sneaking suspicion that Andy Samberg will not be repeating next year.
This is only a medium funny show!
Dave Itzkoff It is so adorable to see Andy Samberg tongue-tied, however.
Jon Caramanica I think we all know Stephanie Beatriz is the star of that show.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaBono talked about one of the most impactful moments he and the Edge experienced with Nelson Mandela, the subject of the film for which they won a best song Golden Globe. On a visit to Robben Island, the normally stoic Mr. Mandela teared up — as much as he could. Because of the work he was forced to do while imprisoned there, Mr. Mandela had lost the use of his tear ducts, Bono said. So seeing him emotional was incredibly memorable. (Mandela later underwent an operation to fix his tear ducts.)Bono also talked about Harvey Weinstein, who distributed “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,” and whom he called a character based on Mr. Weinstein’s early days as a music promoter. “He promoted U2 when we were 20, 21 years old,” Bono said. “And success has not bought him off. He’s gotten worse, not better. He fights for the things he believe in. It’s brute force,” but for the right projects.— MELENA RYZIKDave Itzkoff We literally have 14 categories to go; not even the halfway point.
Jon Caramanica Dave, I will be leaving this liveblog to pursue other dreams.
Dave Itzkoff I hope your daughter someday teaches you everything you know about the human experience.
Jon Caramanica Peace to my future seeds. I’m into the Chips Ahoy Candy Blasts — it’s about to get real.
Dave Itzkoff Emma Thompson swigging her martini at the presenter’s microphone is all ye need know about the Golden Globes. The whole show in one image. Can’t say I’ve ever seen Spike Jonze give an awards-show acceptance speech. Looking forward to it!
Jon Caramanica The YouTube Music Awards would lead me to think this will be very promising!
Dave Itzkoff  “Hey, wait, hold on — I just started,” Jonze protests, as he’s played off roughly 10 seconds into his speech.
Jon Caramanica Amy Adams’s daughter >>> Spike Jonze’s agent.
Dave Itzkoff  Laura Dern’s dad >>>>>>>Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffDave Itzkoff  I just laughed at something Jim Carrey just said. It felt … weird.
Jon Caramanica Was it about how loud his tuxedo was vomiting?
(IDave Itzkoff It was a punch line about Shia LaBeouf, if you must know. A very strong category there, with equally strong expectations that Leto would win. And he did!
Jon Caramanica He’s just too beautiful to look at. Is he talking?
Dave Itzkoff He said something about the “full Brazilian,” and I checked out. But still a great performance in the first film Leto has made in about six years.
Jon Caramanica  Are we sure it’s him deciding on the length of his hiatus?Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff Well, it was worth waiting nearly an hour and a half for another comedy bit from Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, a little character piece featuring Ms. Poehler Randy, as Ms. Fey’s adult child from a previous relationship.
Jon Caramanica Tatiana Maslany actually plays all of these actresses playing all these characters.
Dave Itzkoff Big validation for Netflix, who also had “Orange Is the New Black” star Taylor Schilling nominated in the category.
Jon Caramanica But a big loss for Twitter, who is probably sending Belieber-level darts Robin Wright’s way because Kerry Washington didn’t win.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaAlex Ebert, an indie star and the frontman of the band Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, is the latest musician to make the leap from the pop charts to films, á la Trent Reznor, a Golden Globe and Oscar winner for “The Social Network.” Mr. Ebert’s score for the nearly silent “All is Lost” had to do a lot of heavy lifting to move the story forward, emotionally.“It was intensely liberating, for a songwriter, it was liberating to write a score,” Mr. Ebert said in the press room, adding that he had dropped out of film school to pursue music but still wrote screenplays “all the time.”Because the movie has no dialogue, he added, “there was not really any cues,” for the music. Writing the score “was like setting foot into negative space.”— MELENA RYZIKDave Itzkoff Robert Downey Jr. having the best moment of the show so far.
What’s his asking price to host for three consecutive years?
Jon Caramanica Did he bring in his own writer? Downey doesn’t get out of bed for less than a three-year deal.
Dave Itzkoff Quite a stunning victory for Amy Adams against some very tough competition there. She had the most memorable wardrobe in her film, that’s for sure.
Jon Caramanica And accent, too.
Dave Itzkoff A very dear speech about this being the 15th anniversary since she first showed up in Los Angeles, thinking she might get a commercial or something. And she fought back against being played off until she could name-check her daughter.
Jon Caramanica Do we have research on how many kids each nominee has? Might help us figure out how late this show is going to run.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaJon Caramanica Amber Heard very thoughtful to bring her two bodyguards on stage.
Dave Itzkoff Why did they cut to Rob Lowe the moment they announced Jon Voight’s credit in “Midnight Cowboy”?
Jon Caramanica There is no humility while wearing an opera scarf, Mr. Voight.Jon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff Sorry, still trying to figure out why Kate Beckinsale was helping Diddy and Usher present a music award. “He was on a boat with me, partying on a boat in St. Bart’s,” Diddy explains as Alex Ebert grabs his trophy for “ALL IS LOST.”
Jon Caramanica  I did not know Diddy partied with the Lumineers!
Dave Itzkoff Of course Bono wins the Bono award. He showed up, didn’t he?
Jon Caramanica  Did Idris Elba remix this song? I only want to hear the Idris Elba remix. Adam Clayton apparently has nothing nice to say about Nelson Mandela!Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff “Oh my gosh,” says winner Bryan Cranston, who I suspect is about as surprised as Taylor Swift when she wins an award.
Jon Caramanica THANK YOU TO FRANKIE MUNIZ.
Dave Itzkoff No thanks to whoever dressed Paula Patton.
Jon Caramanica Thematic, though, if you’re into the white flames of a meth lab.
Dave Itzkoff “Breaking Bad” cast celebrates by joyously cracking each other’s necks with the chains they were bound with.
Jon Caramanica Aaron Paul very rudely grabbed that statue from Paula Patton, I thought. In character? In fact, he is in character, closing out with a “Yeah, bitch!”Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff Darn, even the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is getting in a few good lines! Haha, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie doing the old “they gave us the wrong Teleprompter material” bit. Though in their case it didn’t appear to be a bit. Still, handled it with more aplomb than Michael Bay.
Jon Caramanica The Oral History Of The Person Tasked With Printing Out All The Pre-Written Banter On Yellow Sheets Of Paper In Case They Are Needed Because Of TelePrompter Snafus.Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaThe cast discusses their sitcom.The best supporting actress winner Jennifer Lawrence’s speech effusively thanking “American Hustle” director David O. Russell (though not by name) is perhaps a make-up for her Oscar speech last year, when she won for his “Silver Linings Playbook” but didn’t get a chance to mention Mr. Russell.  Then again, that trip up the stairs may have understandably befuddled her.In the press room, Ms. Lawrence was asked how she would celebrate tonight: “I need to catch up on my drinking, I think that’s why I was so manic. Normally, I have time to have a glass of wine. That’s not a good answer. Somebody interrupt!”— MELENA RYZIKDave Itzkoff Elisabeth Moss also extremely worthy, though I’m the teeny-tiniest bit surprised Jessica Lange didn’t take it. She is the anchor of “American Horror Story.” (And either she or Stevie Nicks might cast a hex on me.)
Jon Caramanica Maybe the HFPA is trying to send a message to Fred Armisen?
Dave Itzkoff Yikes.
Jon Caramanica Hey! Also I think it is now a rule that every winner has to reference Jennifer Lawrence.
Dave Itzkoff And swear like a sailor.
Jon Caramanica Otherwise she will see to it that they never work againDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave Itzkoff Part of my heart was rooting for “American Horror Story,” but “Candelabra” had this one in the bag.

Jon Caramanica I can’t believe they made Tamron Hall do this. Maddow was busy? Chris Hayes has an exclusive deal with J Crew.com?
Dave Itzkoff The show has only just begun and we’re already up to one Amy / Tina costume change (since the red carpets). Amy Poehler says hello to all the women and gay men watching at home. My wife and I don’t know how to feel about that.
Jon Caramanica Have they made a single joke yet?
Dave Itzkoff This is definitely a warmer-and-cuddlier opening than last year, very celebratory of the stars in the room.
Jon Caramanica If by cuddlier, you mean “written by a team of publicists,”
then yes.
Dave Itzkoff Still waiting for the bite they brought last year, but it’s early going.
Jon Caramanica As usual, Julia-Louis Dreyfus stealing the show with an e-cig and a brush-off to Reese Witherspoon’s selfie request. And kudos to Amy for pulling off a joke about “12 Years A Slave.”Dave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaDave ItzkoffJon CaramanicaMore photos…Dave Itzkoff Jon, you ready to wade through some red-carpet sewage and begin this?
Jon Caramanica I need like three minutes to exploit the “Girls” promo code on Seamless.
Dave Itzkoff I got that promo, too. It was very tempting. I hope they understand I can’t actually watch “Girls” tonight. So we just got handed a list with 26 awards to be presented on it? Will this possibly be wrapped in time for me to go back and watch “True Detective”?
Jon Caramanica No, but the show will be over by the time Seamless finally delivers your order tonight!
Dave Itzkoff I know the industry is looking at this as a possible bellwether for the Oscars, et al., but I’m just here for the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler opening. It could be 2 hours and 54 minutes of blank screen after that, I’d be fine.
Jon Caramanica And I’m here for the Mani-Cam, so that basically means I can go home in about 15 minutes, right? Certainly, the Oscars are kicking themselves that they didn’t think of the Fey-Poehler tag team first.
Jon Caramanica The Globes don’t threaten the Oscars for prestige rights, but with those two, they’ve effectively established themselves as the show that knows that how Hollywood wants to see itself.
Dave Itzkoff I think we’ll be seeing a very SNL-heavy show, with new “Tonight Show” and “Late Night” hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers also in the house. And it is on NBC, after all.
Jon Caramanica Watching both pre-shows, does it also shock you that the E! affair is far more professional than the official NBC stream?
Dave Itzkoff Uh, E! was also responsible for this. Let’s call it a draw.

Russell version, a.k.a. “American Hustle,” in which he’s played by Christian Bale, finally came together. Right after the scandal broke in the early ’80s, said Richard Suckle, a producer of the film, John Belushi was attached to star, with Louis Malle directing.— MELENA RYZIKIn Hollywood, you find out your studio deal is canceled when someone shows up to measure your office for new drapes — and you’re not redecorating. So little things like seating arrangements matter.If the seating plans at the Globes are any indication, Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, is in good shape. She’s got a prime table, right in front of the stage, with Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and company, from “American Hustle,” all around her. Ms. Pascal’s boss, Michael Lynton, isn’t exactly in the cheap seats. But he’s one table back, next to Tom Hanks and Paul Greengrass, from “Captain Phillips.”Another upfront table features Cate Blanchett, the star of Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine.” Mr. Allen has already said he won’t be there. So his publicist, Leslee Dart, gets a seat.Paramount has a pair of power tables, with the studio chief Brad Grey at one, next to Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese of “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Mr. Grey’s boss, the Viacom chief Philippe Dauman, is a few steps back, with Alexander Payne and the “Nebraska” crowd.But nobody seems to swing as much weight here as Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein’s films have not been in front of the best picture race this year. His table, though, might take a prize for most net worth. He is flanked by the entrepreneurs Ron Burkle and Jim Dolan, and supported by the likes of Taylor Swift, Idris Elba and Meryl Streep. And they are all way, way up front.— MICHAEL CIEPLYMichelle Ashford and Sarah Timberman, two of the executive producers of “Masters of Sex,” which is up for best TV drama tonight, said they were not interested in the material for its pornographic possibilities. “You are talking to two of the biggest prudes in the world,” Ms. Ashford said. “We knew we didn’t want gratuitous sex. We weren’t interested in watching it, we weren’t interested in filming it. We always make sure it’s about something.”Ms. Timberman chimed in: “Sex should be awkward, it should be funny and it should be human, and it should be sort of raw and avoid titillation at all costs.”That doesn’t mean they don’t get a lot of weird letters and comments.“One of out of 25 conversations we have turns out to be a kind of uncomfortable one,” she said.— MELENA RYZIKBruce Dern has been working hard on the awards circuit for “Nebraska,” but at the American Film Institute luncheon on Friday he said he wasn’t nervous about potentially having to give a speech at the Golden Globes should he win for best actor in a comedy. “I never write anything down,” he said. “You just look out at the room and you know what to say.”— MELENA RYZIKThe director Alfonso Cuarón has been celebrated throughout his career, most recently for “Gravity.” But that doesn’t mean he finds the idea of receiving awards comfortable. “The nature of what it is, films are subdivided into categories, competitive and stuff,” he said this weekend. “I’m used to seeing my peers relaxed, in festivals, and you just hang out and have fun.” At ceremonies like the Golden Globes, “suddenly there’s a big elephant in the room.”— MELENA RYZIKThe Spanish-born, German actor Daniel Brühl came to the Globes when he was in his early 20s as a nominee with a foreign film but hasn’t been back since. Now he is a major player, as a supporting actor hopeful, playing the Formula One driver Niki Lauda in “Rush,” which was also nominated for best drama.“It’s been a roller coaster this time because I can remember the wonderful premieres in Toronto and in London, and the reviews were spectacular, the reactions were so positive, but then we were forgotten a bit over the last couple months, because of the other strong films and performances,” he said this weekend. “So I didn’t expect anything to happen. I was really surprised when I got all these different nominations.”— MELENA RYZIKWhen we got to our spot, the red carpet was sopping, and sections of the roof were being replaced. We hope it won’t faze one of the surprise additions to the awards circuit, Barkhad Abdi, the Somali actor making his first feature film appearance in “Captain Phillips.” Playing a pirate opposite Tom Hanks (as the titular captain) in Paul Greengrass’s adaptation of the true story of the raid on the Maersk Alabama, Mr. Abdi said he learned a lot from Mr. Greengrass. “He was more of a teacher to me” than a director, Mr. Abdi said this weekend. To prepare, “I did some training prior to the film, climbing and weapons and skiff and fighting,” Mr. Abdi added. On the skiff, “I had to learn how to stand still. It was hard in the beginning, but it was fun. But no acting training.”The training Mr. Abdi, who lives in Minneapolis with his family, might have most liked to receive is for the red carpet.  “It gets me nervous, honestly,” he said of walking the press line. “I’m learning to get used to it. It’s just like, people asking the same questions.”“Not you,” he added quickly, learning.— MELENA RYZIKAs usual, the savvier publicists scurried around the still mostly empty room, planting name cards to make sure the right person will be sitting next to the right person and, not, God forbid, the wrong one. Perhaps the savviest of the bunch, Nancy Lesser of HBO, was early through the door. She soon had the HBO chief, Richard Plepler, settled near Michael Douglas and Matt Damon of “Behind the Candelabra,” an HBO offering, with Lena Dunham, from the channel’s “Girls,” planted at the table just behind. In a slightly weird touch, perhaps meant to highlight the foreignness of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the publicists and early arrivals were serenaded by what seemed to be a gypsy string quartet, complete with Django Reinhardt-ish guitar stylings and a moody violin. Just steps away, on a smoking balcony, the music sounded more like the soundtrack of “Swingers.” It was all  delightfully, well, discordant.— MICHAEL CIEPLY
The Golden Globes like to bill themselves as the party of the year, and this year, the party may be especially diverse and lively: with new leadership and perhaps a new commitment to being taken seriously, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which gives out the awards, could be riding high. Members asked back Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as hosts, after their well-received turn last year, and the group’s nominees from film and television did not include the usual pop-culture head-scratchers, instead celebrating respected performers like Robert Redford and Meryl Streep and indie stars like Greta Gerwig and Oscar Isaac. The Globes are also spotlighting a host of new TV series, like “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and “House of Cards,” along with raucous films like “American Hustle” and “The Wolf of Wall Street.” “12 Years a Slave” and “Gravity” are also leaders going into the night.Check back for live updates from the red carpet, backstage interviews and commentary, and a tally of winners during the ceremony.— MELENA RYZIKCara Buckley is your guide on the red carpet to the news and the nonsense of awards season, covering the Golden Globes, the Oscars and more.
