A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.★ Ben Allison Group (through Saturday) For about 15 years the bassist Ben Allison has been a bandleader-composer of reliable intelligence and modest but meaningful surprises. Most of the musicians he has assembled here — the multireedist Ted Nash, the guitarist Steve Cardenas and the drummer Rudy Royston — are regular partners. One, the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, is a more recent collaborator, and an all-around compelling addition. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)★ Marcus Belgrave Quintet (Tuesday and Wednesday) Marcus Belgrave, 78, is a figure of peerless veneration in Detroit, where he has variously served as a staff trumpeter for Motown Records, a trusted purveyor of hard-bop verities and a hands-on mentor and educator to several generations of jazz musicians. For this engagement he features his wife, the vocalist Joan Belgrave, along with the tenor saxophonist Marcus Elliott, the pianist Ian Finkelstein, the bassist Marion Hayden and the drummer Gayelynn McKinney. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jalc.org; $35 cover, $25 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Cyrus Chestnut (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Chestnut is a pianist with a full, resonant touch and a gift for handling the prerogatives of post-bop with a gospel kick. He returns to the scene of his deeply satisfying new album, “Midnight Melodies” — improbably, his first-ever live recording — with the same unassailable rhythm team of Curtis Lundy on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com; $38 cover, with a variable minimum. (Chinen)Jon Faddis Quartet (Thursday through July 27) The trumpeter Jon Faddis, a bebop savant and high-note specialist who has acclimated nicely in recent years to a professorial mode, celebrates his 61st birthday with this run, in the company of several longtime associates: the pianist David Hazeltine, the bassist Todd Coolman and the drummer Dion Parson. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jalc.org; $40 and $45 cover, $25 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Roman Filiu (Friday and Saturday) This alto saxophonist has kept exalted company in and out of his homeland, Cuba, working with partners like the pianist David Virelles, who joins him here. The engagement, which will feature new work commissioned by the Jazz Gallery, also features Ralph Alessi on trumpet, Dayna Stephens on tenor saxophone, Matt Brewer on bass, Craig Weinrib on drums and Yusnier Sánchez Bustamante on percussion.

(Chinen)Follow the Stick (Wednesday) The stick in question is a clarinet, by means of some outmoded slang, and the person wielding it here will be Sam Sadigursky, whose recent albums have been gracefully high-minded explorations of poetic form. Here Mr. Sadigursky pays a more straightforward homage to the clarinet’s legacy in 1930s and ’40s small-group jazz, working with the pianist Bobby Avey and the drummer Jordan Perlson. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Fred Hersch Trio (through Sunday) “Floating” is the engrossing new album by this acoustic trio, the current vehicle for Fred Hersch’s deeply lyrical brand of pianism. Returning to a room ideally suited to its sound and style, the group — with John Hébert on bass and Eric McPherson on drums — will finesse a similar blend of jazz standards and prepossessing originals, the best of which seem plausible as future standards themselves. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 and $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)★ Jazz in July (Tuesday through Thursday and July 29 through 31) This summer concert series, programmed by Bill Charlap, takes a fondly nostalgic view of jazz and American songbook traditions. Its 30th anniversary edition begins on Tuesday with a tribute to Hoagy Carmichael by way of Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke, whose trumpet legacies will be handled by a worthy inheritor, Jon-Erik Kellso. On Wednesday the focus turns to Leonard Bernstein, a source of productive inspiration for Mr. Charlap; Thursday’s concert pays homage to Miles Davis, with Jeremy Pelt on the horn. More details (and the following week’s lineup): 92y.org. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500; $52 and up, $25 for 35 and under. (Chinen)Sean Jones Quartet  (through Sunday) The assertive postbop trumpeter Sean Jones has a convincing new album, “im.pro.vise = never before seen,” featuring the same sterling rhythm section found here: Orrin Evans on piano, Luques Curtis on bass and Obed Calvaire on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 and $30 cover. (Chinen)Joe Locke (through Sunday) The kinetic and harmonically sophisticated vibraphonist Joe Locke draws partly from a ballads-centric recent album, “Lay Down My Heart,” with a band featuring the singer Kenny Washington, the pianist Jim Ridl, the bassist Lorin Cohen and the drummer Clarence Penn. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jalc.org; $35 to $45 cover, $25 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)★ Jane Monheit’s Jazz Party (Sundays through Sept. 28) Ms. Monheit is a jazz singer who has always fit the profile of an ingénue, though she has developed shades of complexity in her interactions with the standard repertory. She continues her Sunday night series at Birdland, during which she’s developing new material with her trusted band, including the pianist Michael Kanan, the bassist Neal Miner and her husband, the drummer Rick Montalbano. At 6 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Miles Okazaki Quartet (Thursday) The most recent album by the guitarist and composer Miles Okazaki is “Figurations,” a cerebral but thrilling showcase for his elaborate designs. It was recorded live at the Jazz Gallery, the institution that next week presents his current working band, with Donny McCaslin on tenor saxophone, François Moutin on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. At 9 and 11 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org; $22, $10 for members.

(Chinen)Oscar Peñas (Wednesday) Mr. Peñas, a crisp Catalan guitarist, has a new album, “Music of Departures and Returns,” that suggests a spin not only through the music of his heritage but also that of Cuba and the Americas. He draws from it here, with the pianist Leo Genovese, the bassist Moto Fukushima and the drummer Richie Barshay. At 10 p.m., Whynot Jazz Room, 14 Christopher Street, at Gay Street, West Village, 646-756-4145, whynotjazzroom.com; $10 cover. (Chinen)Lenny Pickett (Tuesday) A bracingly soulful tenor saxophonist best recognized for his long tenure with the “Saturday Night Live” band, Lenny Pickett recently released “The Prescription,” somehow only his second album as a leader. The album pairs him with the national jazz orchestra of Finland; this club stand will feature a couple of his “SNL” band mates, along with the guitarist Wayne Krantz and the drummer Steve Wolf. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 cover.

(Chinen)Tom Rainey Trio (Friday) Tom Rainey, a precisely off-kilter drummer, has broken into bandleading of late, often with the partners in this trio: Ingrid Laubrock, a tenor and soprano saxophonist of exploratory instincts, and Mary Halvorson, a guitarist with a sharp-splintered but flexible attack. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Pete Rodríguez Quintet (Saturday) Last fall, on “Caminando con Papi,” the trumpeter, percussionist and vocalist Pete Rodríguez paid brilliant homage to his father, the salsero and original Fania All-Stars member Pete (El Conde) Rodríguez, who died in 2000. For this one-nighter uptown, Mr. Rodríguez leads an excellent band with the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Ricardo Rodriguez (no relation), the percussionist Robert Quintero and the drummer E.J.

Playing this week is Bria Skonberg, an Armstrong-inspired trumpeter who also sings. She’s also been among the most effective recent ambassadors for hot jazz.
