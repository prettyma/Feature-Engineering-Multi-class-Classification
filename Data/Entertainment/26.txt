The 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, recognizing television’s best, took place at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles on Monday night. “Breaking Bad” and “Modern Family” repeated last year’s wins for best drama and comedy, respectively. Dave Itzkoff and Jon Caramanica of The Times live blogged the ceremony, which was hosted by Seth Meyers and broadcast on NBC. Dave Itzkoff O.K., here we go. “Breaking Bad.” You called it, Jon.Jon Caramanica Well, there you go. Is Jim Parsons in this, too?Dave Itzkoff And when they erase my earlier prediction, I will have called it, too. I don’t think anyone feels the same … resentment as they did about “Modern Family”? Yes, “Breaking Bad” is a repeat winner, but a highly merited one. In its final half-season.Jon Caramanica HALF-season. MINI-season. Maybe next year these acceptance speeches will be honored with a Best Variety Show Emmy?Dave Itzkoff Clearly the achievement the Emmys are most proud of is ending on time. Everything else is incidental.Jon Caramanica Early, even! They needed to make room for this Very Intense Katherine Heigl Promo.Dave Itzkoff Should we do the dignified thing and wrap it up ourselves?Jon Caramanica We might end on time, Dave, but we are never the respectable choice.Dave Itzkoff The nominations seemed to suggest that this would be a change year — “Orange Is the New Black,” “House of Cards,” “True Detective” — and yet it wasn’t. That’s about as profound a thought as I can offer.Jon Caramanica It feels a lot like the Grammys! In so much as there is an old guard in this world, it won here tonight.Dave Itzkoff Yes. It says a lot that McConaughey — a newly minted Academy Award winner — would have represented deviation from the norm at the Emmys. Instead his category was won by a homegrown TV star and veteran trophy hoister, Bryan Cranston. It’s its own form of presidential politics. You may win the nomination, so to speak, but you’ve still got to win the general election.Jon Caramanica At root, it shows a reluctance on the part of longtime professionals to acknowledge the changes that have been roiling their industry for years, and are going to keep rewriting it in the coming years. Like you said, it’s a Chuck Lorre town.Jon Caramanica Jay Leno! They are really trolling Seth Meyers hard tonight.

Dave Itzkoff

 He made that introduction through clenched teeth. Oh, also, “Modern Family” won something.


Jon Caramanica

 Remember when “Modern Family” felt radical? Do you think that, as they’re up there, they know how many people think this is a terrible outcome? (And yet, I like most of these actors.)


Dave Itzkoff

 The series is still a behemoth in so many ways. And massively influential on what’s coming down the pipeline this season. It works, and on a network sitcom, that’s hard to underestimate. Though they’ll still play Steve Levitan off the stage to come out on time.


Jon Caramanica

 The “Modern Family” diaspora – write that!

 The “Breaking Bad” flush continuing. 


Dave Itzkoff

 Must’ve been that last-second Julia Roberts jinx. This definitely tips the scale.


Jon Caramanica

 Where was JLD to kiss him?


Dave Itzkoff

 “Even I thought about voting for Matthew,” says Cranston.


Jon Caramanica

 Also I would have chosen Harrelson over McConaughey, if we’re going there.


Dave Itzkoff

 Even Harrelson conceded he was going to lose to McConaughey — he just didn’t know McConaughey was going to lose too. Quite a gracious speech by Cranston, for as many times as he’s won previously. Last time he’ll get to do it for this role, anyway.

Indeed, some outstanding performances in that category.

Jon Caramanica

 This was a tough category!


Dave Itzkoff

 And as Ms. Margulies points out, she’s in a network show that has to do a mighty 22 episodes a season. Remember what that used to be like?


Jon Caramanica

 Even Margulies is #teamjoshcharles. We are for sure approaching the end of the 22-episode show cycle. How will we be able to tell the difference between a mini-series and a regular show when each of them are three episodes long? I feel like at least some of what we’re seeing here is the network folks asserting their (alleged) primacy


Dave Itzkoff

 How so?


Jon Caramanica

 By leaning on established talents on established network shows for big prizes.


Dave Itzkoff

 The nets have to go home with something, right? Remember when the Emmys started off with a win for Ty Burrell and “Modern Family”? That sure seems like a long time ago.

And any excuse to hear Joe Morton enunciate is a winner.Dave Itzkoff  It was only ever a question of which “Breaking Bad” episode would win, and not much of a question at that. “Ozymandias” was an episode that some dare say was even superior to the “Breaking Bad” finale, “Felina.” I don’t think Heisenberg would appreciate their attempt to play her off stage, however.Jon Caramanica Well they let the show director have like a four-minute acceptance speech before!The “In Memoriam” segment noted the passing of “the” Abby Singer.

 Hope she’s enjoying her stay at one of those exotic marigold hotels.

  I agree with you, though — sort of a fun parlor game to see what he does with these instrumentals. Or will we later learn that the Emmy writers did all the lyrics and he’s just the front?
Dave Itzkoff Well, Weird Al is having a moment. To coin a phrase. I like the conceit of writing lyrics for shows with instrumental theme songs.

 While I don’t expect a moment tonight on the order of Blue Ivy’s “Good job, Mommy,” I am provisionally excited for these Emmy Awards. It’s a Seth Meyers, “True Detective,” “Orange Is the New Black” kind of night. That’s enough to look forward to.


Jon Caramanica

  I enjoy maybe 1.5 of those 3 things, so maybe I will be having less fun than you tonight. I will try to keep spirits high, though.


Dave Itzkoff

 Any competitions you’re looking forward to? Are you counting the minutes until the epic McConaughey/Harrelson/Cranston/Spacey bro-down?


Jon Caramanica

  I suppose I am looking forward to people freaking out if and when “The Big Bang Theory” beats “Louie.”


Dave Itzkoff

 You are a cynic in the classic Greek sense. Perhaps a Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Amy Poehler victory will turn that frown upside down.


Jon Caramanica

 #teamjoshcharles. If Nic Pizzolatto wins, will his acceptance speech just be a list of footnotes and attributions?


Dave Itzkoff

 It would be pretty rad if they just announced the #TrueDetectiveSeason2 cast from the Emmys stage. And it’s Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.


Jon Caramanica

 Dave, you are excited about Seth Meyers, yes?


Dave Itzkoff

 I am!


Jon Caramanica

 I’m so sorry. He just said on the red carpet not to expect jabs at individual shows or actors, only thematic comedy about, you know, the state of television. He’s a card, that guy.


Dave Itzkoff

 Oh, well maybe he was doing it in the guise of one of his many SNL characters.

Dave Itzkoff Oh, well maybe he was doing it in the guise of one of his many SNL characters.With the Primetime Emmys and MTV Video Music Awards broadcast on successive nights this year, we asked readers to tell us which show they think is more important. Do the MTV awards, now in their 31st year, distill what’s big in popular culture? Or do the Emmys better define the entertainment that we consume by crowning the best of what some say is a new golden age of television?Several Times readers responding came down on the side of the Emmys.One reader captured the fleeting nature of youth in describing why she thinks the Emmys are more culturally relevant:. #NYTEmmys, I’m 50 with many friends 27-29yo. The younguns think they’ve aged out of the #VMA2014.— diana biederman (@dianauws) 25 Aug 14And other readers were more stark about how age factors into the way they see the MTV awards:Millennial trash vs Gen X class?  I’ll take the Emmys #NYTEmmys The only thing I see coming out of the VMAs is the fall of our empire.— Pete the Cat (@PeteTheCat) 25 Aug 14Favorite TV shows were also cited as reasons that the Emmys were more important:Answer: Battleship on FX. RT @nytimesarts: Which matters more: The Emmy Awards or the VMAs? Tell us with #NYTEmmys //t.co/xO85WuqupX— Michael Martinez (@MikeMartinezDC) 25 Aug 14But the age factor also came up as a reason both the Video Music and Emmy Awards offer up useful cultural signposts:#nytemmys vma young emmy old! both relevant— igwos (@igwos_) 25 Aug 14Then again, some Twitter users thought we were asking the wrong question:Or which matters less “@nytimesarts: Which matters more: The Emmy Awards or the VMAs? Tell us with #NYTEmmys //t.co/7oJkhAgV1f”— Cathleen Carr (@Cathleen_Carr) 25 Aug 14@nytimesarts #NYTEmmys yawn.  VMA yawn.

Don’t believe me. I won’t mean it. #Emmys— Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) 25 Aug 14Just used some fake tan that I got free in a goody bag. It successfully turned the grey bits of my beard ginger. Perfect. #Emmys2014— Ricky Gervais (@rickygervais) 23 Aug 14Which awards show is more culturally relevant in 2014? The Primetime Emmy Awards or the MTV Video Music Awards? We’d like to hear the opinions of Times readers. You can share yours with us using the hashtag #NYTEmmys on Twitter, or write them in the comments here.Quirks of the calendar put the VMAs and the Emmys on back-to-back nights this year. While there may be some overlaps in audience, the two awards shows celebrate two very distinct forms of entertainment. And so we invite readers to debate this question based on articles written in the past day by Emily Steel, a Times media reporter, and Jon Caramanica, a music critic. In her preview of tonight’s Emmys broadcast, Ms. Steel describes how the Emmys, once a celebration of an entertainment industry backwater, have gained luster. She writes that “as traditional and digital networks ramp up their original productions and attract some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Emmys are soaring to new levels of artistic — and for some networks, financial — importance.”In his review of last night’s VMAs, Mr. Caramanica examined the show in its 31st year and MTV’s diminished role in spreading popular culture. He writes that the VMAs were “dominated by a class of relative newborns who, just a year ago, were barely famous enough to be in the building to watch Miley Cyrus scandalize a nation.”What do you think? Do the VMAs continue to serve as a vanguard in popular culture? Or are the shows, performers and producers of the television programs celebrated at the Emmys more relevant to what entertains us as a culture today? Share your opinions on Twitter and we’ll gather some of your perspectives here on the blog ahead of the Emmys broadcast tonight.— MICHAEL ROSTONObservers have been known to complain that the Emmys recycle the same nominees year after year, making room for only a few newbies at a time. So in advance of tonight’s ceremony on NBC, we asked you to tell us who you would have nominated, TV Academy rules and industry pets be damned. Some agreed with the official list of contenders, but many others put forward completely different suggestions. And while we didn’t bring in PricewaterhouseCoopers to tabulate anything, there was a clear reader favorite: “Bob’s Burgers” on Fox.A few Emmy Awards were handed out on Aug. 16, and “Bob’s Burgers” did actually win for best animated program, just as our readers called it:“Bob’s Burgers” should win this award in a landslide vote.
 — Mitchell, Haddon Heights, N.J.Hands down, “Bob’s Burgers” (or anything with Kristen Schaal), followed closely by “Futurama.” “South Park” has to be in there somewhere, because it sometimes operates on an entirely different plane. It is often so funny that laughter seems to be an inadequate response.
 — gemli, BostonBut one voter went even further, nominating it for best comedy:In an ideal world, “Bob’s Burgers” or “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” In real life, “Silicon Valley.” (But honestly, I’d take ANYTHING over “Big Bang Theory” or “Modern Family.”)
— Lizbeth, N.Y.Speaking of best comedy, shows that weren’t really eligible like “Inside Amy Schumer” and “Key and Peele” (technically considered variety shows) received shout-outs, as did a few cult favorites and at least one not-at-all eligible show:Why no mention of “Episodes?” I still don’t get “Modern Family” or “Big Bang Theory.” I don’t give them any nomination.
— Uniack, Woodside, NYI’ve been watching “Silicon Valley,” which I enjoy but don’t really understand. Just shows that when something’s funny, it’s funny.
— Emily Emirac, New York City“The Mindy Project.” Period.
— Rick L., NYC Of those that were nominated, I’d have to go with “Louie” as well. But, for what makes me laugh at least once daily, it’s still “Seinfeld.”
— Alan Chaprack, New York, NY

As for comedy performers, readers would have given Matt LeBlanc, the “Episodes” star, some love, and one wondered why a different “Big Bang Theory” star wasn’t nominated:
I was very happy to see Jim Parsons win the first time, but since then I don’t see that he has actually done much more with the character. That’s not really a criticism of him, but I don’t see the point of repeatedly rewarding someone for giving the same performance. It’s also a shame that his co-star Johnny Galecki doesn’t get some recognition.
— Jim, Boston

For lead actress in a comedy, Mindy Kaling of “The Mindy Project” was mentioned, but most readers preferred the TV Academy’s contenders, including Taylor Schilling of “Orange Is the New Black” and especially Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who is nominated for “Veep”:
She is the smartest, funniest actress working in television today. She carries her show like no other actress in her category. The bathroom scene in the final episode of this past season between her character, Selena, and Tony Hale, as Gary, was so brilliant, and had me in tears — I was laughing so hard.
— Ken L., New Jersey

On the drama side of the ledger, “The Killing,” “The Good Wife,” “Fargo” and “The Americans” each had their partisans. Surprisingly, “Game of Thrones” and “Downton Abbey” did not have a lot of defenders. So, at least among readers, the race comes down to two favorites. We’ll let the readers make their cases:
“TRUE DETECTIVE”! “TRUE DETECTIVE”! “TRUE DETECTIVE”!
— Regular Meg, PA
If there were kind justice for this year’s Emmys, every individual involved with the final episodes of “Breaking Bad” — in front of and behind the camera — would receive an Emmy. All other eligible categories would be temporarily changed to Best ___________ Not in “Breaking Bad.”
— JR, Chicago, IL

Among drama actresses, several names were mentioned, including the nominated Julianna Margulies of “The Good Wife” and the snubbed Keri Russell of “The Americans.” Several argued in favor of the overlooked Mireille Enos of “The Killing”:

Ms. Enos is as good as anyone working today in films and TV. I will miss her (and Joel Kinnaman) as the most compelling cop partners that I can recall and I am 64.
— David Izzo, Durham, NC

And Lizzy Caplan, who is up for “Masters of Sex” tonight, had her partisans:

She is the force around which all else and everyone else in “Masters of Sex” revolves.
— Momus, Out west

But one name ruled them all:
Tatiana Maslany, “Orphan Black,” BBC America — six nominations? For each character she plays.
 — Rolf Rykken, Washington, D.C.
Is there no degree of difficulty in acting, like Olympic diving or skating? Tatiana Maslany plays many different characters who are identical genetically and tints each one with the colors of different nurturing. Not hard enough? She then plays one of those character imitating another of those characters and creates a third character in between the two.
 — William, Werick

Finally, for lead actor in a drama, a few readers spoke up in favor of three nominees — Jon Hamm of “Mad Men,” Woody Harrelson of “True Detective” and Jeff Daniels of “The Newsroom.” Many hearts and minds were with these overlooked stars:
Matthew Rhys in “The Americans” would get my vote without a doubt. Great show, great acting. But like “The Wire” and “Friday Night Lights,” it’s been ignored. You’re in good company, show!
 — Lainie, Lost Highway
Oh — there’s just something about shamblin’ Joel Kinnaman in “The Killing.” What a delight. He would get my vote hands down.
 — TL, NYC

But the overwhelming sentiment was with a not-exactly-overlooked actor, Peter Dinklage of “Game of Thrones.” He is up for best supporting actor, which is the wrong category if you ask our readers:
Wow was Peter Dinklage really not nominated for best actor? What a joke.
 — Donald Quixote, NY, NY

Peter Dinklage. Nomination or not (and he certainly IS the heart of “Game of Thrones”), I give him my own personal Emmy.
