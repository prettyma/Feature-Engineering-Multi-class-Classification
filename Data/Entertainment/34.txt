(Sunday) The affable punk junkie of “Saturday Night Live” resumes his torrent of cover songs by his favorite artists, from the Clash to Hüsker Dü, with assistance from mystery guests. Dare we hope that his “Portlandia” collaborator Carrie Brownstein will storm the stage to slag along to some MC5, or that the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl will be on hand to help Mr. Armisen reprise their “SNL”-bred hardcore band, Crisis of Conformity? At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484, union-pool.com; $8. (Stacey Anderson)The Avett Brothers (Wednesday) Brotherly love informs the folk-country vigor of the Avett Brothers, comprised of the multi-intrumentalists Scott and Seth Avett and the bassist Bob Crawford. Their Rick Rubin-produced “I and Love and You” (Sony) was a highlight of 2009 for its textural complexity and subversive punky energy. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; sold out. (Stacey)Anita Baker (Sunday) Ms. Baker’s quiet storm of R&B-soul is in motion again. After taking a decade away from the spotlight to spend time with her family, the 1980s chart phenom returned with the tender, live-recorded “My Everything” (Blue Note) in 2004. A Christmas disc and lengthy tour ensued. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (866) 858-0008, ticketmaster.com; $45 to $129.50. (Anderson)Advertisement★ Beach Boys (Tuesday and Wednesday) Though Brian Wilson still isn’t much of a surfer, he can be proud to ride this wave: the 50th anniversary tour of the greatest pop band of the 1960s. The founding members Mike Love, Al Jardine and Mr. Wilson reunite for the first time in decades, along with classic-era members Bruce Johnston and David Marks, for a nostalgic spin through the sounds of summer. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (866) 858-0008, beacontheatrenyc.com; $59 to $250. (Anderson)AdvertisementBrendan Benson (Saturday) As Jack White supports his solo album and the Raconteurs take an indefinite hiatus, their secret weapon prepares his own road odyssey. Mr. Benson, a singer-songwriter of five excellent alternative country/rock albums, furthers his gravelly, heartland anthemics on the recently released “What Kind of World” (Readymade). With Young Hines. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Anderson)★ Andrew Bird and Patrick Watson (Friday) World-class whistling is just one of Mr. Bird’s musical attributes; he also casts off effortless runs on violin, bends percussion into peppy swing and patches various electronic devices into self-sustaining mini-orchestras. The resulting melee would be a twee curiosity if he weren’t so gifted at intuitive pop melodies. With the excellent chamber-pop specter Patrick Watson, whose eponymous band will support their new record “Adventures in Your Own Backyard” (Domino). At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (866) 858-0008, beacontheatrenyc.com; $40 to $45. (Anderson)The Cranberries (Friday) The purring Irish dream-pop quartet behind “Linger” and its accompanying 1993 breakthrough album, “Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?” (Island), reunited in 2009 and released its overdue sixth disc, “Roses” (Downtown), in February. On it the singer Dolores O’Riordan still found moments of angelic resolution. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; sold out. (Anderson)★ Crossing Brooklyn Ferry with St. Vincent and Beirut (Friday and Saturday) The brothers Aaron and Bryce Dessner, of the Brooklyn-beloved rockers the National, handpicked the lineup of this remarkable new festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and its mostly local stars prove alluring at every turn: St. Vincent, Beirut, the Antlers, Oneohtrix Point Never, My Brightest Diamond, Tyondai Braxton and more. At 5 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, crossingbrooklynferry.com; $45 per day. (Anderson)★ Dirty Beaches (Friday) The pop abstractionist Alex Zhang Hungtai splices rockabilly hooks with noir sound effects to create atmospheres that are warmly familiar yet spectrally distorted. His David Lynch-inspired debut, “Badlands” (Zoo), recalls an idyllic beach bonfire interrupted by a thunderstorm. His live act is startlingly aggressive, a balancing act of guitar fuzz and guttural howls. With Xiu Xiu and Father Murphy. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, boweryballroom.com; $16 in advance or $18 at the door. (Anderson)★ Feist (Saturday) Leslie Feist, a pop sphinx with slowly galvanizing melodies and regal disposition, began her national tour with two weekends at the placid Coachella festival. Her sets displayed new balance between her best material: arrestingly bare confessionals to start, jovial and fully orchestrated electric symphonies to close. With Timber Timbre. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (866) 858-0008, ticketmaster.com; $40 to $50. (Anderson)Florence and the Machine (Tuesday) Florence and the Machine’s keening, old-soul orchestral pop can be staid in a live setting, but the dark glamour of Radio City is the best setting imaginable for these British romantics. The band’s newest track, “Breath of Life,” features aggressive synths and appears on the soundtrack for the soon-to-be-released film “Snow White and the Huntsman.” At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (866) 858-0008, ticketmaster.com; $35 to $95.

His 2008 album, “Ghost Town” (Important), segmented sharp rock pace with jazzy squeals of electronics. At 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10. (Anderson)Advertisement★ Zola Jesus (Thursday) The hippest space on Museum Mile concludes the Divine Ricochet series, three concerts that augment the current “John Chamberlain: Choices” retrospective. The final installment welcomes Zola Jesus, a Russian-American wild child with a piercing wail and heavy, electro-industrial melodicism. Her 2011 album, “Conatus” (Sacred Bones), landed like a heavier screed from Siouxie Sioux. With JG Thirlwell and the Mivos Quartet. At 8:30 p.m., the doors open with a private viewing of the exhibition; the performance begins at 10 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423 3500, guggenheim.org; $27 for general admission, $22 for members. (Anderson)Lady Antebellum (Friday) On the strength of its crossover single “Need You Now,” this contemporary country trio was the runaway victor at the 2011 Grammy Awards, netting five trophies. It even usurped the heavily favored collaborations of Eminem with Rihanna and Jay-Z with Alicia Keys for record of the year. The group commands its most famous New York stage yet in support of its third album, “Own the Night” (Capitol Nashville). With Darius Rucker and Thompson Square. At 7:30 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (866) 858-0008, ticketmaster.com; $55 to $95. (Anderson)Liturgy (Friday) The Brooklyn black metallers Liturgy exuded convincing, mercurial despondency on last year’s “Aesthethica” (Thrill Jockey). They return to the gothically inclined St. Vitus tavern, an increasingly less hidden gem for the loud music set. With Extra Life, Castevet and Mario Diaz de León. At 8 p.m., St. Vitus, 1120 Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, saintvitusbar.com; $12. (Anderson)★ M83 (Thursday) The sixth studio record by this French electro-pop act is a gorgeous, literally somnolent experience: a double album that explores the dreams of a brother and a sister, one sibling per disc, in boundless paths of innocent euphoria and autumnal poignancy. The New Wave beats and keening orchestral soundscapes, abetted by a volcanic opening track cameo from the singer Zola Jesus, add up to an incongruously lovely flight of fancy. With I Break Horses. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; sold out. (Anderson)Red Hot Chili Peppers (Friday) Gracious to a fault, these recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees nodded to their venerable peers with the release of “We Salute You” (Warner Bothers) earlier this week. The digital EP features six raucous covers of previous Hall honorees, including “Search & Destroy” by Iggy & the Stooges, “Suffragette City” by David Bowie and “I Get Around” by the Beach Boys. At 8 p.m., Prudential Center, 165 Mulberry Street, Newark, (800) 745-3000, prucenter.com; $63. (Anderson)★ Scissor Sisters (Sunday) Intense showmanship elevates every performance by these disco-rock locals; the lead vocalists, Jake Shears and Ana Matronic, churn the stage with bright wit and ecstatic dancing. Their soon-to-be-released fourth disc, “Magic Hour,” includes a collaboration with the equally glamorous D.J. du jour Calvin Harris. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (800) 745-3000, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Anderson)Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros (Tuesday and Wednesday) A pack of tribal-painted, feather-bedecked bohemians, the frontman Alex Ebert and his clamorous backing instrumentalists had a big debut with the hit “Home,” from their 2009 album “Up From Below” (Vagrant/Rough Trade). They follow the wind back to Manhattan for their first East Coast date in support of “Here” (Community/Vagrant), which will be released on May 29. With Fool’s Gold. At 9 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, roselandballroom.com; $35. (Anderson)Spiritualized (Monday) On this British space-pop band’s third studio album, “Ladies and Gentlemen...We Are Floating in Space” (Dedicated), minimalism married rich orchestrations like few albums before or since. The bandleader Jason Pierce’s New Age Wall-of-Sound production dips into skronky noise with aplomb on the recently released “Sweet Heart Sweet Light” (Fat Possum). With Nikki Lane. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; $30 in advance or $35 at the door. (Anderson)★ Rufus Wainwright (Wednesday) The prodigious theatrical-pop composer boasts seven albums, an opera and one of the finest-ever covers of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” to his name. For his latest record, “Out of the Game” (Decca), he paired with a similarly savvy, similarly pompadoured producer, Mark Ronson; the result is a fine vintage effort of 1970s-influenced soft rock. At 8 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $45 and $65.
