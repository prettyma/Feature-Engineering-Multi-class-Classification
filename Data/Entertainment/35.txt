(Sunday) The affable punk junkie of “Saturday Night Live” offers a torrent of cover songs by his favorite artists, from the Clash to Hüsker Dü, with assistance from mystery guests. Dare we hope that his “Portlandia” cohort, Carrie Brownstein, will storm the stage to slag along to some MC5, or that the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl will help reprise the “SNL”-bred hard-core band Crisis of Conformity? At 8 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484, union-pool.com; sold out. (Stacey Anderson)Bilal (Tuesday) This lascivious, New York-based R&B crooner and his curious, frequently space-age beats are a solid male foil to Janelle Monáe; until the cosmos aligns, though, he’ll have to settle for a résumé that includes collaborations with Beyoncé, Jay-Z, the Roots and Robert Glasper. At 9 p.m., S.O.B.’s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (866) 777-8932, sobs.com; $25 to $150. (Anderson)★ Björk (Sunday and Wednesday) This pop innovator’s live spectacle for “Biophilia” (Nonesuch) has more enticements than a swan dress has feathers. For her residency at the New York Hall of Science, she offers towering pendulum harps, state-of-the-art multimedia visuals, two functioning Tesla coils, a 24-woman Icelandic choir and even a corresponding monthlong science curriculum for schoolchildren. The experience, and even its accompanying whiplash, should be nothing short of glorious. (Her Thursday concert was canceled because of illness; watch the calendar.) At 8:30 p.m., New York Hall of Science, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (800) 745-3000, nysci.org; $75 to $150. The hall opens at 6 p.m. on concert nights for displays of “Biophilia” items. (Anderson)AdvertisementDie Antwoord (Saturday) The rapid-fire clip and glitchy tonalities of this South African rap group represent zef, a proudly lowbrow counterculture shift in the region’s hip-hop climate. The pair’s bleached, bloodied and otherwise vampires-at-the-rave visages make the genre initially appear intimidating, when in fact the group’s parade of self-professed commonality is refreshingly accessible; its second disc, “Ten$ion” (Zef Recordz), was released this month. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Anderson)AdvertisementGuns N’ Roses (Friday, Sunday and Wednesday) The little cover band that could embarks on its Northeast tour with a Manhattan mini-residency, spearheaded as always by Axl Rose, the singer and defiant remaining member of the classic lineup. Wednesday’s foray at Webster Hall nods to the group’s legendary 1988 gig “Live at the Ritz,” with the club’s one-night reversion to its former name and décor. Brush the mothballs off your top hat. Friday at 9 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, roselandballroom.com; $79.50. Sunday at 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-6600, terminal5nyc.com; sold out. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (800) 745-3000, websterhall.com/events; $125. (Anderson)John Hammond and John Mayall (Thursday and Feb. 17) These two blues guitarists have palled around with rock’s greatest improvisers — Mr. Hammond with Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, Mr. Mayall with his own Bluesbreakers, Mr. Clapton and Mick Taylor. This joint jam of rhythm and blues promises electricity. At 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $55 and $65. (Anderson)★ Marketa Irglova (Wednesday) Ms. Irglova is the fairer half of the Swell Season, the folk duo with her “Once” co-star Glen Hansard. That touching film’s Academy Award-winning success also steered the course toward her solo debut, “Anar” (Anti-), a quietly lovely piano-pop achievement. At 7 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Anderson)José James (Friday and Saturday) The starry-eyed M.C. from Brooklyn has a grave edge to his gentle R&B cadences, which tugs his brassy fusion of hip-hop and jazz back from the brink of schmaltz. The classy digressions of his recent breakthrough album, “For All We Know” (Impulse!), paint him as a burgeoning Gil Scott-Heron. At 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 281-9240, Ext. 19 or 20, harlemstage.org; $25, or $20 for members.

The Kills’ latest album, “Blood Pressures” (Domino) from 2011, proved brazen in its newfound vulnerability, especially the sepia-tinged waltz “The Last Goodbye.” With Jeff the Brotherhood and Hunters. At 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; sold out. (Anderson)Low Cut Connie (Thursday) These smirking conduits of classic barroom boogie show their cards on the self-released “Get Out the Lotion”: infectious roots-rock guitar, libertine lyrics about women and whiskey and more than a slight penchant for the mythical paradise of “Big Thighs, NJ.” Dive-bar bachelor parties need no other soundtrack. At 9:30 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $14. (Anderson)Pauly D (D.J. set)  (Tuesday) Accept the myriad futilities of life and/or Midtown with this Valentine’s Day set from the “Jersey Shore” star. As the former opening spinner for Britney Spears’s Femme Fatale Tour, the flat-topped character is no stranger to slick exhibitionism. At 10 p.m., Pacha, 618 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 209-7500, pachanyc.com; $20; couples $30. (Anderson)Romeo (Saturday) As the premier heartthrob of Bachata, an increasingly influential derivation of Dominican Republic pop rhythms, Romeo (Anthony Santos) holds millions of teenage girls’ dreams on his slender shoulders. However, thanks to his former frontman duties with Aventura, this is old news to him, and to Madison Square Garden. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (866) 858-0008, thegarden.com; $64 to $164. (Anderson)AdvertisementRalph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys (Sunday) What has changed in America since Harry S. Truman was president? Not Mr. Stanley’s banjo; the stalwart bluegrass musician has been performing solo, with family and in this talented ensemble since 1946. The Library of Congress, knowing history when it saw it, anointed him a Living Legend in 2000. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, bbkingblues.com; $29.50 in advance or $35 at the door. (Anderson)Richard Thompson (Tuesday to Thursday) This recent BBC Radio Lifetime Achievement Award winner once serenaded Britain alongside his ex-wife, Linda Thompson; he continues to romance audiences with his lavishly folksy acoustic guitar compositions, which have been covered by Robert Plant, Bonnie Raitt and more. This smattering of City Winery dates follows an all-requests format, so shout out heartily for “Madonna’s Wedding.” At 8 p.m., City Winery, 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, (212) 608-0555, citywinery.com; $40 to $60. (Anderson)★ Tibet House Benefit Concert (Monday) Last year, at this annual gala for the Dalai Lama-commissioned educational center, the Roots scorched the earth with their cover of Neil Young’s “Down by the River” and the Flaming Lips had a sober duet with Philip Glass. This year’s installment features the artistic direction of Mr. Glass, a longtime Tibet House advocate, as well as sure-to-be-surprising performances from Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, Antony Hegarty (of Antony and the Johnsons), Rahzel, Das Racist and many more. At 7:30 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $33 to $95. (Anderson)Ed Vallance (Sunday) This London-born singer-songwriter delivers contemporary pop with a classic elegance, an expansive suavity and just a touch of aloof trendiness. In other words, he is the exact sonic incarnation of the Ace Hotel. He offers excerpts from his second album, “Volcano” (Riot Act), on the inn’s dime every Sunday of this month. At 10 p.m., the lobby of the Ace Hotel, 20 West 29th Street, Manhattan, (212) 679-2222, acehotel.com/newyork; free. (Anderson)A version of this schedule appears in print on February 10, 2012, on Page C22 of the New York edition with the headline: The Listings.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
