The Times’s standards editor, Philip B. Corbett, invites readers to correct grammatical errors in recent New York Times articles. You can take previous quizzes here.
Here’s the latest installment of our copy editing quiz, based on internal memos I send to the newsroom about problems in our writing and editing.Each of the passages below, from recent Times articles, contains at least one clear error in grammar or word usage. I’m not counting less-than-elegant phrasing that could be improved, or other more subjective editing judgments.You don’t have to explain the error or fix it; just click on the part you think is wrong. If I agree, you’ll see my explanation. If you’re off base, try again.And remember, we’re on deadline here!Spot an error in The Times?
