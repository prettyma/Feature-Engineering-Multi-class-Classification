The House on Thursday passed its version of a tax bill, largely along party lines. Every Democrat voted no, but so did 13 Republicans, many of whom represent districts in high-tax states that could be particularly hurt by the repeal of the state and local income tax deduction.The Senate is working on its own tax bill, and Republicans say they hope to pass a reconciled version through both chambers by the end of the year.Most of the Republicans who voted no represent districts with a high average state and local tax deduction, which would be scaled back significantly under the House plan. Taxpayers would no longer be able to deduct state and local income and sales taxes, and the property tax deduction would be limited to $10,000.The changes in the bill would primarily hurt higher-income taxpayers who deduct more than the higher proposed standard deduction ($12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married couples) and those who currently deduct more than $10,000 in property taxes.An earlier version of this article misstated the source of information for state and local tax deductions. It is the Government Finance Officers Association, not the Tax Policy Center.Advertisement
