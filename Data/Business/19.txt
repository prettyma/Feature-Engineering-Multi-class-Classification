Apple's 2.4 percent drop year-to-date in 2018 is its steepest since 2016, although in that year the company had already reported by the end of April.The latest hit to the stock came in mid-April after a warning on global demand from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the world's largest contract chipmaker, reminiscent of one from Cirrus Logic Inc five years ago.Apple is estimated to have sold 53 million iPhones from January through March, a 4.4 percent increase year over year, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.(Apple iPhone sales: https://reut.rs/2rbKV2M)Total revenue is expected to have risen 15 percent to $60.84 billion, with net profit jumping 24 percent to $13.68 billion, or $2.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(Apple YTD gains in the last 5 years: https://reut.rs/2jjYJE7)However, the iPhone sales estimate is down 9.4 percent from three months back, amid reports of waning demand. The revenue estimate has fallen 7.4 percent and profit estimate by 3.8 percent.

That is almost double the equivalent number for its main phone industry competitor, Samsung Electronics, but below U.S. tech peers Alphabet or Microsoft.
