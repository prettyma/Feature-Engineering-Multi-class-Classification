You will hear little from organized psychiatry on this matter, because of the warning to its members that it is unethical to state a professional opinion about the president’s behavior without a personal examination or his consent.Most of my fellow psychiatrists are not aware that there is an exception to this ethics code: the extended analyses of world leaders under controlled conditions of scholarship.Jerrold Post founded the Central Intelligence Agency’s personality analysis center, and I witnessed him speak at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, where he said it is unethical for mental health professionals not to contribute during these perilous times.Earlier this year, Dr. Post, who studied Kim Jong-un and his father, warned in a Washington Post article that Kim’s capacity for brutality and his apparent spontaneity could be compounded by President Trump’s own impulsive acts.Common sense suggests that a small, impoverished country should not be allowed to cause a nuclear war and that the world powers can together use their heads and find a way to prevent this — that is, assuming that our leaders don’t want war.JEFFREY B. FREEDMAN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Nicholas Kristof says the Congressional Research Service estimates that as many as 300,000 people could die in the first few days of war with North Korea. He quotes a Stanford security expert who thinks that number could easily be a million if it were a nuclear exchange.Senator Lindsey Graham then relays a conversation he had with President Trump, in which he says Mr. Trump insisted: “If thousands die, they’re going to die over there. They’re not going to die here.”That seems to be a particularly chilling calculus. Apparently this president believes that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents would be acceptable, as long as they are not American deaths.That may play well with his base, but history might think otherwise.MITCHELL KAPNER, CARY, N.C.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
