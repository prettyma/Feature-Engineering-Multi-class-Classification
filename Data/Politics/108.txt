I never thought for a minute that Mr. Comey sought to change the outcome of the presidential election, the balance of power in the Senate and the philosophical leaning of the Supreme Court.I also have no doubt the aw-shucks Jimmy Stewart impersonator did all three — not out of partisanship or venality, but out of an unspeakably arrogant naïveté and self-absorption.Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers plummeted after Mr. Comey’s October surprise, which left her campaign virtually defenseless as F.B.I. agents reviewed her email messages.Mr. Comey’s Shakespearean-scale blunder put a sword in Mrs. Clinton’s back and led to the election of a dangerous, corrupt buffoon. Regardless of his intentions, his hubris has done our nation more lasting harm than words can capture.DAVID A. SCOTT, COLUMBUS, OHIOTo the Editor: David Leonhardt fashions a fairy tale dressed up as a Greek tragedy when claiming that James Comey acted out of “hubris” in an effort to “protect his own fearless image” by speaking “truth to power” when he went public with the reasons for not charging Hillary Clinton.The motivations he attributes to Mr. Comey are utterly misplaced. I’ve known Jim Comey for over 32 years since we were law clerks together. Jim doesn’t have an arrogant bone in his body and would never put any thought of himself above his duty.As for speaking the truth, that is Jim’s nature. If the powerful happen to be in the room, they’ll hear the truth, too. The tragedy in Washington is that there are too few men and women in power who share Jim Comey’s character.JACK MENZ, WESTPORT, CONN.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
