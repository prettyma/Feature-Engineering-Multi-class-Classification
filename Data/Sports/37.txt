O.K., O.K. So you probably didn’t pick Harvard on Thursday night. Or Wichita State. But you had Oregon’s upset, right? And Cal? … Well, fine, but a lot of people disrespect the Pac-12, so your bracket is probably still alive in the office pool and you need to keep up with Friday’s action. Zach Hillesland, Mike Huguenin and Times editors and reporters will supply updates from around the country.


1:03 A.M.2nd Day of Tourney Definitely Memorable


The second day of the 2013 N.C.A.A. Tournament forever will be remembered for 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast’s shocking upset of No. 2 seed Georgetown – just the seventh win by a No. 15 seed in tourney history. The stunner came in F.G.C.U.’s first-ever tourney game. (And, hey, how soon will we be hearing “Hey, why don’t we play football?” talk from some F.G.C.U. folks.)
There were five other upsets Friday, as well: No. 9 Temple over North Carolina State, No. 10 Iowa State over Notre Dame, No. 11 Minnesota over UCLA, No. 12 Ole Miss over Wisconsin and No. 13 La Salle over Kansas State. Interestingly, four of the six upsets (all but Temple’s and La Salle’s) had double-digit victory margins.
In all, there were 10 upsets in the tourney’s first round (two of those were No. 9s beating No. 8s). The biggest damage has come in the West Region, where half the upsets have occurred. When the second round gets under way Saturday, the region will be without the No. 3 (New Mexico), No. 4 (Kansas State), No. 5 (Wisconsin), No. 7 (Notre Dame) and No. 8 (Pitt) seeds. And top-seeded Gonzaga barely escaped Thursday against Southern.
There were two upsets apiece in the East and South regions and just one in the Midwest, which was considered the strongest of the four regions. The East is missing its No. 5 and 8 seeds; the South its No. 2 and 6 seeds; and the Midwest its No. 5 seed.
In terms of remaining conference representatives, the Big Ten – which had seven selections – leads with six. The Atlantic 10 has all five of its selections left. The A.C.C., Big East and Pac-12 each have three left, while the Big 12, Missouri Valley, Mountain West and S.E.C. have two each. The Atlantic Sun, Conference USA, Ivy and West Coast have one apiece.
The Big East has been the biggest disappointment, with five of its eight selections already gone from the tourney. One overriding theme: The Big East’s losing teams lacked top-flight athleticism.

12:38 A.M.Minnesota Routs U.C.L.A.


U.C.L.A. cut the lead to five early in the second half, but it was all Minnesota after that as the 11th-seeded Golden Gophers rolled to a 20-point win. In what almost certainly was his last college game, Bruins freshman Shabazz Muhammad scored 20 points but on 6-of-18 shooting. The Bruins shot 32.3 percent as a team.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




12:28 A.M.Kansas Fends Off Hilltoppers


Kansas is going to close out 16th-seeded Western Kentucky from the foul line, and while the Jayhawks were far from dominant — far, far from dominant — the idea in March is to survive and advance and the Jayhawks did that. But Kansas better had show up with a better effort Sunday when it plays offense-minded North Carolina. K.U. should be able to hammer U.N.C. in the lane, but Kansas’ backcourt could be in trouble.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




12:04 A.M.Kansas Looks Safe Now

Pleasing a hugely pro-Jayhawks crowd in Kansas City, Kansas has opened a 10-point lead with a bit less than four minutes left against 16th-seeded Western Kentucky. The Hilltoppers seemingly have forgotten how to shoot in the second half. 
— MIKE HUGUENIN




12:01 A.M.Clock Might Have Struck 12 for Western


Western Kentucky’s hopes for an epic upset of top-seeded Kansas probably just ended with the fifth foul on Hilltoppers forward George Fant, who was one of two Western players in double figures. Kansas leads 48-42 with about five minutes left. Western has scored just 11 second-half points.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




11:57 P.M.Irish Bow Out Meekly.


Seventh-seeded Notre Dame fell to Iowa State, 76-58, and the Fighting Irish’s performance put a capper on a dismal first-round performance by the Big East. The conference had eight teams selected for the field, but just three remain (Louisville, Marquette and Syracuse). To add to the misery, three league teams lost to worse-seeded squads (No. 2 Georgetown to No. 15 Florida Gulf Coast, Notre Dame to Iowa State and No. 8 Pitt to No. 9 Wichita State). And if No. 14 Davidson hadn’t melted down in the final minute, it would’ve taken out No. 3 Marquette. The other league losers were Cincinnati and Villanova.
Also worth noting: The three Big East winners beat teams from low-major leagues (Louisville over North Carolina A&T from the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Syracuse over Montana from the Big Sky and Marquette over Davidson from the Southern).
Final: 76-58 #IowaState runs #NotreDame out of UD Arena. Just a throttling from start to finish. #Cyclones might just give Ohio State a test

11:38 P.M.U.C.L.A. Off Its Game

Was looking forward to the U.C.L.A. dance team’s routine at halftime. But like the Bruins, it stalled when the wrong music was cued up. The dancers recovered nicely. Now we’ll see if the players do.
U.C.L.A. shot 26 percent (8 of 30) as Minnesota took a 35-25 lead behind a nice mix of man and zone defenses. Austin Hollins had 11 for the Gophers, who got hot after a foul-plauged start. They shot 46 percent (14 of 30).
If Minnesota wins, this will have to stand as the high drama in Austin. Top seeds Miami and Florida won impressively. Illinois just won.
— TOM SPOUSTA




11:25 P.M.Minnesota Looking Good. Can It Last?


Minnesota was one of the best teams in the nation early, starting the season 15-1. But the Golden Gophers were barely mediocre in the second half of the season, losing 11 of their final 16 games; they had lost three in a row and five of seven heading into the N.C.A.A. tourney.
Minnesota looks to have found a salve for its woes, playing sixth-seeded U.C.L.A. tonight. The Golden Gophers lead by 10 at halftime. They have shot the ball well, and have put the clamps on the Bruins. U.C.L.A. has hit just 26 percent from the field and star forward Shabazz Muhammad is 0-of-7 from the field.
Thing is, U.C.L.A. has been pitiful, yet is within striking distance. And Minnesota showed in the second half of the season that it is far from a sure thing.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




11:20 P.M.Iowa State is Rolling


Iowa State is spanking seventh-seeded Notre Dame, leading by 16 with seven minutes gone in the second half. The Cyclones enjoy a huge advantage in athleticism and the Irish look overmatched.

— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13

— MIKE HUGUENIN




11:05 P.M.An Upset Brewing?


There is no fathomable reason to expect 16th-seeded Western Kentucky to take down top-seeded Kansas, especially in Kansas City. But Western actually leads 31-30 at halftime.
Western is 20-15 overall and finished fourth in the East Division of the relatively low-rent Sun Belt Conference before getting hot and winning the conference tourney title. In its one game against a power-conference foe that made the N.C.A.A. field, Western lost by 23 to Louisville on Dec. 22. And this is a team that was swept this season by Florida Atlantic; not Florida or even Florida Gulf Coast – Florida Atlantic.
The athletic Hilltoppers are shooting 46 percent from the field and have outrebounded the taller Jayhawks, 18-11. In addition, Western has done a great defensive job on Kansas guard Ben McLemore, who has just two points. Western has thrown a variety of defensive looks at the Jayhawks, who don’t seem fully engaged in the contest.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




10:48 P.M.O.U.-S.D.S.U. Tied


Oklahoma and San Diego State looked evenly matched on paper, and it has been that way on the court, too. The 10th-seeded Sooners lead 33-31 at halftime; the winner faces Florida Gulf Coast on Sunday.
Sooners coach Lon Kruger is the first coach to take five schools to the N.C.A.A. tourney; he previously attended the Dance with Kansas State, Florida, Illinois and U.N.L.V.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




10:42 P.M.Iowa State Whipping Irish

No. 10 seed Iowa State has received balanced scoring and is wreaking havoc with its defense in taking a 35-23 halftime lead on Notre Dame. The Irish look slow and plodding against the Cyclones, who have seven steals and have forced 14 turnovers.
Clyburn with a 3 at the buzzer to give #ISU a 35-23 lead going into halftime. The #Cyclones are pumped up
— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13

— MIKE HUGUENIN




10:41 P.M.Ugly Ball in Austin 


So does defense still win championships, or is there just some bad basketball being played here in Austin?
Except for Florida of course. The Gators just held Northwestern State, the nation’s highest scoring team (81 points per game) to 15 points in the second half in a 79-47 rout. Florida, though, does play defense, allowing the third fewest points in the country this season. 
“I wasn’t really pleased with our defense in the first half,” said Gators Coach Billy Donovan. “They shot too high of a percentage.”
That wasn’t a problem for Illinois. The Illini earlier Friday scored only 20 points in the second half. And won by 8.
And now we bring you the No. 6-seed UCLA Bruins vs. the No. 11 Minnesota Golden Gophers. If you took higher seeded UCLA, you took the underdog. Minnesota is favored by about 3 points. Hey, this could be a good one, you say.
Five minutes into the nightcap, it’s Gophers 2, Bruins 0.
Ugh.  
— TOM SPOUSTA




10:38 P.M.What is Up with Kansas?


The Kansas-Western Kentucky game, at least early, is looking a lot like Thursday’s Gonzaga-Southern 1-16 matchup. As with Southern, Western Kentucky is athletic, playing some junk defenses and is fearless going to the basket. Southern was able to hang close all game. Given that Kansas basically is playing a home game in Kansas City, it seems unlikely that Western can do the same. Then again, if tourney neophyte Florida Gulf Coast can beat Georgetown, why can’t Western — a mid-major blue-blood — do the same to Kansas?
— MIKE HUGUENIN




10:31 P.M.Snowy Forecast for Kansas City


Depending on which forecast you trust, four to eight inches of snow are expected in Kansas City from late Saturday into Sunday. It shouldn’t cripple the city but will make things messy for folks driving in for Sunday’s games, so Dan Gavitt, son of the late Dave Gavitt and the NCAA’s vice president of men’s basketball championships, issued this statement minutes ago:
“We are monitoring the weather situation on the ground and in our tournament control center and are fully prepared. We do not anticipate any game delays.
“Prior to the tournament, all venues submit emergency management plans to the NCAA national office for review. During the tournament, NCAA onsite coordinators are in regular contact with facility management at every venue to manage any situation that may arise.
“In Kansas City, all of the teams and officials are already onsite. We are exploring extending their hotel stays if their travel is delayed after the games because of inclement weather.
“This region routinely has winter snow and has the appropriate equipment and procedures to manage these winter conditions.
“We encourage fans planning to attend games to pay attention to the weather, use good judgment and follow any directions from local authorities regarding travel and weather.”
I think I can sum this up in four words: Be smart. Carry on.
— PAT BORZI




10:26 P.M.Yawn. Kansas Needs to Wake Up


Kansas looks a bit distracted in its 1-16 matchup with Western Kentucky. The top-seeded Jayhawks lead by just two at the second TV timeout. Western is athletic but usually is a poor shooting team.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




10:03 P.M.Tough on the Eyes


If you’re feeling a bit tired after a long day of watching the tourney, an easy way to wake up is to tune in to the Iowa State-Notre Dame contest. For some reason, Notre Dame thinks it is smart to again wear neon-green shoes and socks. Geez. On a big screen in HD, viewers might just go blind.
Can’t get into Notre Dame’s neon flare. I feel like I’m watching Space Jam, or something else from the early 90s.

9:37 P.M.North Carolina Advances

Wow. Jackson Simmons missed three straight foul shots for Carolina, two with 11 seconds to play, then the first of two with 8.3 seconds.  
Still that looked like enough, and it was. Carolina wins, 78-71. If Kansas can knock off Western Kentucky next, Roy Williams will face the Jayhawks for the third time in the NCAA Tournament. He lost the first
two, most recently last year.
— PAT BORZI




9:36 P.M.Gators Winning a Blowout


Florida’s defense decided to show up in the second half and the Gators are mauling 15th-seeded Northwestern State (La.). Northwestern State scored 32 in the first half but has managed just 11 in 14 minutes of second-half play. Florida leads by 26.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




9:34 P.M.Heels Pull It Out


North Carolina withstood a mid-game lull and got past Villanova 78-71. The Wildcats dominated in the paint but couldn’t handle the Tar Heels’ perimeter players.
The Tar Heels almost certainly will play Kansas in the next round (the top-seeded Jayhawks have Western Kentucky later tonight). While Heels coach Roy Williams (who earned his 700th victory with the win) has been gone from Kansas for 10 seasons, there still almost assuredly would be a few tears shed by Ol’ Roy regardless of the outcome if the Heela and Jayhawks meet.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




9:32 P.M.Florida Is Fine With Georgetown’s Demise


The announcement of No. 2 seed Georgetown’s demise was met with loud cheers here, mostly from No. 3 Forida fans. The Gators, like the Hoyas, were put in the South Regional, which leads regional final next weekend in Arlington, Tex., at Cowboys Stadium. Florida would have met Georgetown if the seeds had held.
Florida’s talent and depth has shown up and the Gators are pulling away from Northwestern State. Four players, led by Erik Murphy’s 16 points, have already scored in double figures.
 Casey Prather just dunked on a semi-fast break to put Florida ahead 63-42 with 8 minutes left.
After Georgetown defeat, Florida now has about a 40 percent chance to reach Final 4, according to @fivethirtyeight //t.co/TQXYO1Kp0Q
— NYT Sports Live (@NYTSportsLive) 23 Mar 13

— TOM SPOUSTA




9:29 P.M.UNC Holding Off Nova


Back-to-back North Carolina turnovers allowed Villanova to score six  straight points to cut the Tar Heel lead to 67-66. But Marcus Paige’s 3-pointer and two foul shots kept Carolina in front. Now it’s 72-68
with under a minute to play.
— PAT BORZI




9:18 P.M.That Is 7th Win by a No. 15


Florida Gulf Coast’s victory was the seventh time a No. 15 seed has won a tourney game since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Three of those wins have come in the past two tourneys. None of the 15s has won a second game.
Cheers in Dayton when scoreboard shows Georgetown’s loss. The stands are still full here, despite a 29-point #Buckeyes lead w/ 3 min
— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13

— MIKE HUGUENIN




9:16 P.M.Ohio State Have This One


Ohio State is putting the finishing touches on a dismantling of No. 15-seed Iona in front what was essentially a home crowd here in Dayton, Ohio. Physically, the Gaels were just completely outmatched by the Buckeyes. They needed to shoot it lights out to be able to hang in, and they did not. Not even close. 33 percent. And, with 5 minutes remaining, Ohio State has as many assists as Iona has field goals (20)
— ZACH SCHONBRUN




9:15 P.M.Oh, My



Photo

Going into the tourney, Florida Gulf Coast was a nice, quirky little story. The Eagles are in just their second season of full Division I eligibility and their coach, ex-NBA assistant Andy Enfield, is married to a former model who graced the covers of magazine such as Maxim and Elle. But come on – a team that was swept by a 12-win Lipscomb team was going to hang with second-seeded Georgetown? Yes, F.G.C.U. did beat Miami, but it also lost 10 games.
Well, the 15th-seeded Eagles – who finished second in the Atlantic Sun in the regular season – have pulled the shocker of the tourney, stunning the Hoyas – who won a share of the Big East title – with a 78-68 decision.
In busting brackets everywhere, Florida Gulf Coast also opened up the South Region. Georgetown was seen as a legit threat to top-seeded Kansas, but now third-seeded Florida (assuming the Gators continue to fend off Northwestern State), fourth-seeded Michigan and fifth-seeded V.C.U. have to have big smiles.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




9:08 P.M.Florida Gulf Coast Stealing Thunder 


There’s 7:57 to play at the Sprint Center, North Carolina leads 54-50, and they’re showing highlights of the Florida Gulf Coast-Georgetown game. Out of town scores are hard to read in the arena, and fans without smartphones just gasped at the score.
— PAT BORZI




9:05 P.M.Nova and UNC Battling 


The cheers of North Carolina fans drowned out the boos from Kansas fans when ex-Jayhawks Coach Roy Williams was introduced before the Tar Heels played Villanova, but the booers may have the last laugh.  
Carolina has blown a 20-point first half lead and trails 55-54 with 12:26 to play. Kansas has the next game, with their almost all their fans fans in their seats now, the last few minutes ought to be a hoot.
— PAT BORZI




8:46 P.M.Villanova Now Leads


Villanova trailed North Carolina by 17 early, but the Wildcats have continued to grind and now lead, 44-42, six minutes into the second half. Villanova really has clamped down on defense against the Heels, who never will be mistaken for a physical team.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




8:41 P.M.Up and Down for These 2s


Ohio State looks to have taken control of its 2-15 matchup against Iona, opening up a 19-point lead early in the second half. But 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast continues to lead against Georgetown; the Eagles own a 59-45 advantage with a bit less than eight minutes left in the game. The Eagles are getting excellent play from sophomore point guard Brett Comer, who has 10 points and eight assists and hasn’t been fazed by Georgetown’s defense. Comer is used to playing with high-profile players: He was the backcourt mate of the New Orleans Hornets’ Austin Rivers for three seasons at Winter Park High in the Orlando suburbs.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




8:33 P.M.Gators Lead by Eight at Halftime


Northwestern State (La.) remains within striking distance of No. 3 Florida, trailing 40-32 at halftime. Northwestern is getting and hitting its shots, but Florida is scoring easily inside because of its height advantage. Frankly, if Gators center Patric Young had any offensive skills, Florida would be up by 14 or 15.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




8:27 P.M.Florida Having Trouble With Northwestern State


Say this for Northwestern State fans: they came prepared and have reason to cheer and talk a little trash.
 “This isn’t LSU, this is NSU baby!” one Demon fan shouted.
 He and several other Demons wielded toy tridents with stuffed Gators impaled on the end of them. They also wore purple shirts that read “Rise To The Occasion.” 
So far, NSU has. It’s Florida, 28-24, with 7:46 left in the first half. Coach Mike McConathy’s 5-man substitution waves haven’t really bothered the Gators, but NSU has set a solid pace and Florida has yet to find its gear.   
And say this for Gator fans here: they look and sound nervous.
— TOM SPOUSTA




8:20 P.M.Who Are These Guys?

Maybe it’s time to believe in 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast. The school, located in Fort Myers, is in just its second season of full Division I eligibility, but it leads Georgetown by 13 with 14 minutes left. The Eagles scuffled some early, but they are just as athletic as the Hoyas and are playing extremely loose. Georgetown, meanwhile, lost as a No. 3 seed in the second round last season and is playing extremely tight.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




8:16 P.M.Florida Gulf Coast in Charge


Big things might be a-brewin’ in Philly. No. 15 seed Florida Gulf Coast leads Georgetown by eight at the first TV timeout of the second half. The Hoyas hit the wall offensively midway through the first half and now can’t score.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




8:16 P.M.Iona Trails Ohio State by 10 at the Half


Iona started full-court pressing to slow down Ohio State’s offense in the first half, after falling in a 27-8 hole. They managed to cut the lead down to 10 at the half. But the Buckeyes shot 52 percent and held Iona, the second-highest scoring team in the country, to just 33 points and 34 percent shooting. Iona hasn’t scored fewer than 62 points yet this season.
#Iona heads into halftime trailing, 43-33. Went on a 25-10 run to cut the lead down to eight, but #Buckeyes still seem in control
— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13

— ZACH SCHONBRUN




8:13 P.M.Villanova Fights Back


North Carolina looked as if it was going to blow out Villanova, but the Wildcats started playing some defense and trail 37-29  at halftime against the Tar Heels. U.N.C. scored just seven points in the final 7:47 of the half.
North Carolina played noticeably better basketball after switching to a small lineup in February, but Heels have been sloppy with the ball tonight (11 turnovers) and have only nine rebounds. Thing is, Villanova has 12 turnovers and the Heels were taking advantage of those early in the half.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




8:05 P.M.Iona Looking to Hang Around


Iona looks to have weathered an early storm and is in the game against second-seeded Ohio State in Dayton. The Buckeyes jumped out to a big early lead, but the Gaels have settled in offensively and now trail by just eight with about two minutes left in the first half.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




7:59 P.M.Florida Defense an Issue


Florida is one of the best defensive teams in the nation – the Gators rank second nationally in stats guru KenPom.com’s defensive efficiency ratings – but the Gators are having trouble with Northwestern State’s fast-paced attack. Third-seeded Florida leads 19-17 less than eight minutes into the game. Florida is scoring at will inside, but its defense is getting shredded.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




7:49 P.M.Heels Are Rolling


North Carolina is torching Villanova in an 8-9 matchup, leading by 17 at the under-8-minute TV timeout. The Wildcats’ defense looks lost.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




7:46 P.M.Georgetown’s Offense Is A.W.O.L.


No. 15 seed Florida Gulf Coast is shooting just 30 percent from the field and 46 percent from the line, but still leads second-seeded Georgetown, 24-22, at halftime. The Hoyas have made just 33 percent of their shots from the floor, including 1-of-8 from 3-point range, and 37 percent from the line.
Only six No. 15s ever have won an N.C.A.A. tourney game, including two last year.
With Florida Gulf Coast near an upset, here’s our story from the weekend. Most interesting team in the tourney: //t.co/hqtI3DsrTk

7:33 P.M.Buckeyes Rolling


Unlike Georgetown, a No. 2 seed that is letting a No. 15 hang around, Ohio State is blitzing Iona. Playing in front of a virtual home crowd in Dayton, Ohio, the Buckeyes lead by 14 less than eight minutes into the game. Iona likes to run, but Ohio State’s defense is causing all sorts of problems for the Gaels.
#Buckeyes are running and dunking here — or basically playing #Iona’s own game against them. 20-6
— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 22 Mar 13

— MIKE HUGUENIN




7:21 P.M.Hoyas in a Close One Early


Florida Gulf Coast has played inconsistent offense, but a 6-0 run has the Eagles – in just their second season as a full-fledged Division I member – trailing second-seeded Georgetown by just 18-17 with about seven minutes left in the first half.
The Hoyas lost in the first round as a No. 3 seed last season, and while they have a decided height advantage over the Eagles, Florida Gulf Coast has been able to hang around because the Hoyas are shooting poorly.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




7:07 P.M.An Ugly Win for IIllinois 


No wonder coaches and experts have been lamenting the demise of skill and fundamentals in college basketball. 
Exhibit A-whatever:  Illinois 57, Colorado 49.
Good Lord. Calling this game mediocre would be kind.
The Illini shot 13.6 percent (3 of 22) in the second half; the Buffs shot 32 percent (9 of 28). 
Illinois looked angry with itself as the final horn sounded, and aside from a few low-key high-fives, didn’t really celebrate. Colorado just looked defeated.
Still, when Xavier Johnson nailed a 3-pointer from NBA range with 16.9 seconds left to pull within 55-49, it seemed like the Buffs had a chance.
Survive and advance was never more true than this one.
— TOM SPOUSTA




6:58 P.M.Illinois Moves On


Seventh-seeded Illinois had a poor offensive showing in the second half but still had enough to hold off Colorado, 57-49, and advances to play Miami. Illinois shot just 30 percent from the field for the game.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




6:42 P.M.Another Close Finish


Illinois leads Colorado by four with 3:14 left, which means another close finish in a tourney that has had too few of those. Illinois’ offense has been brutal in the second half, but building a big first-half lead obviously has its advantages.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




6:38 P.M.Illinois and Colorado Trading Blows

It was an epic shooting slump. So cold and astounding that it was hard to turn away. Illinois just went 11 minutes, 27 seconds without scoring a basket, going 0 for 15 in that stretch.
Nothing that Coach John Groce scribbled on his board during timeouts worked. And it’s not like the Buffs were playing lock down defense.
Tracy Abrams finally ended the drought with a lay up, but now Colorado leads 44-42.
And now Illinois can’t miss, going on a mini-run to take a 48-44 lead with 5:58 to play. 
Ugly, but amazing.
Welcome back to the tourney, Buffs.
— TOM SPOUSTA




6:27 P.M.Illini Hit a Basket


Illinois just hit its first field goal of the second half — with 8:32 left in the game. The Illini trail Colorado by just three, though.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




6:25 P.M.Indiana Takes Care of Business


Unlike some other one-seeds (ahem, Gonzaga), Indiana takes care of business against James Madison with an 83-62 win that was never in doubt. Hoosiers shot 52 percent from the field and out-rebounded JMU, 39-24. Leading scorer: Yogi Ferrell, who scored 16 points with 7 rebounds and 6 assists. It will be Indiana vs. Temple on Sunday.
— ZACH SCHONBRUN




6:10 P.M.Buffs Get Even Closer


Colorado has opened the second half with a 14-2 run and has cut IIllinois’ lead to four at the first T.V. timeout of the half. The Buffs had good defensive numbers this season, but they sure played lousy defense in the first half,. Illinois hasn’t hit a second-half field goal, and the Buffs are feeding off that on the offensive end. Colorado enjoys an advantage in athleticism, and coach Tad Boyle obviously told his players to use that advantage at halftime.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




6:03 P.M.Buffs Get Back Into It


Colorado has opened the second half with a 9-2 run against seventh-seeded Illinois and has cut the lead to nine. The Buffs have hit some 3-pointers to get back into it; now they have to get more physical on defense to stay in it.
— MIKE HUGUENIN




5:59 P.M. Indiana’s Depth and Balance on Display


Victor Oladipo, a candidate for national player of the year, has been quiet here against James Madison, with only 6 field goal attempts in the first 30 minutes of the game. He has been more of a facilitator, while Yogi Ferrell (14 points), Cody Zeller (11 points), Jordan Hulls and Will Sheehey (8 points each) lead the offense. Indiana’s depth and balance offensively has been on clear display. James Madison doesn’t know who to double team next.
With Indiana ahead, 68-35, w/ 8 minutes left, the Temple team has left their seats. I think they’ve seen enough #Hoosiers #Owls
— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 22 Mar 13

— ZACH SCHONBRUN




5:57 P.M.Hoosiers Winning Easily


Indiana is going to beat James Madison rather handily. The question is whether the Hoosiers can become the third team in this tourney to win by 40-plus points. I.U. leads by 33 midway through the second half and should become the fifth team to win by at least 29.
Syracuse and V.C.U. each won by more than 40 on Thursday. Miami won by 29 earlier today and Louisville by 31 Thursday night.

5:50 P.M.12-13 Matchup a Regular Thing


La Salle’s upset of fourth-seeded Kansas State means that for the third tournament in a row, there will be a 12-13 matchup in the round of 32; La Salle plays 12th-seeded Ole Miss on Sunday.
In addition, although there was no 12-13 matchup in the 2010 tourney, Sunday’s game will be the sixth 12-13 contest in the past six tourneys; there were two in 2008.
The bad news for La Salle (which already has won two games in this tourney, as it downed Boise State in a play-in game) is that the No. 12 seed is 4-1 against the No. 13. But that 13 win came last season, when Ohio downed U.S.F.
As for Ole Miss, the Rebels were the third No. 12 seed to win in this tourney. But don’t necessarily think the No. 12s are Cinderella stories: Each is a power-conference school (Ole Miss is from the S.E.C., and the other two No. 12s to win – Cal and Oregon – are from the Pac-12).

5:48 P.M.A Colorado Collapse?

It’s Illinois 37-21 at halftime, and the Buffs are on the verge of getting blown out for one simple reason: guard play, the axiom for greatness in March. The Illini start three guards — D.J. Richardson, Brandon Paul and Tracy Abrams — and they controlled every aspect of the first half. They combined for 27 points on 9 of 19 shooting; Colorado’s backcourt of Askia Booker and Spencer Dinwiddie totaled just 8 points, going 2 of 9. Well, somebody from the Pac-12 eventually had to lose, and it looks like the Buffs are it.
— TOM SPOUSTA




5:41 P.M.Looking Back, Looking Ahead


Yogi Ferrell followed up his hot start with a complete first half performance: 14 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists.  The rest of the scoring was quite balanced and the Hoosiers are looking every bit a number one seed.
I’m already getting anxious for a potential Indiana-Syracuse showdown in the Sweet 16.  Indiana is a better team with better psychological and emotional balance, but if Syracuse can properly orchestrate for one game, things could get very interesting.
Much like yesterday, this tournament has thus far proven that only one-seeds and two-seeds are sacred. Everyone else is up for sacrifice, and game after game has shown seeding to be utterly inconsequential. My bracket hasn’t been this ugly since I was ten, and that’s only because I used crayons and glue that time.
There are so many good games still to be played today but I’m already starting to fantasize about some of the weekend matchups. Michigan-V.C.U., Butler-Marquette, and Duke-Creighton have already started to wrinkle my brain. With that being said, Minnesota-U.C.L.A. and North Carolina-Villanova should provide enough action to keep me placated until then.

5:33 P.M.A Coach’s Classy Goodbye

Just had to share this after listening to Pacific Coach Bob Thomason following his team’s blowout loss to Miami. Thomason is retiring after 25 years as coach of his alma mater, and his post-game comments were among the classiest I’ve ever heard, any sport.
After saying he had never been to Austin before, and thanking everybody for their hospitality, he continued: “I’d like to thank and congratulate Miami on advancing. Great team, great pieces, they played tremendous, shot the ball well, rebounded the ball well, played good defense. And I’ll be rooting for them the rest of the time. So maybe they can win a national championship. If I had to go out in coaching, you want to go out to a great team, but also to a great coach and a class coach, and Jim [Larranaga] is that.”
— TOM SPOUSTA




5:24 P.M.Close Finishes in the Afternoon

They went back and forth in the final minute, but Creighton made enough free throws and Cincinnati’s Sean Kilpatrick had a potentially beautiful prayer go unanswered, and the Bluejays were able to hang on and advance.
McDermott finished the day with 27 points and 11 rebounds, and Creighton heads off to the next round to play Duke. I can’t wait to watch that one. I wonder how much time Plumlee will spend on McDermott and vice versa.  
In another down to the wire finish, LaSalle was able to hang on and win after they blew an 18-point lead in the second half. Kansas State’s Bruce Weber looked like he was absolutely on fire on the inside as he was walking through the handshake line.   That one will undoubtedly be a tough one to swallow.  The Wildcats hurt the most, my bracket next most.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




5:16 P.M.Illinois, Colorado, Intensity


It’s on in Austin.  Clearly, these two teams don’t like each other. “C’mon Big Ten” an Illinois fan shouted just before tip-off. And when an Illini player went to the foul line, Colorado fans countered with this clever chant: “Quiet! He’s shooting a free throw!””Quiet! He’s shooting a free throw!”
And it’s only Illinois 16, Colorado 15 eight minutes into the game.
The Frank Erwin Center here suddenly has the atmosphere of a college basketball game. Loud, proud, packed and the crowd obviously very aware that, so far, the Pac-12 has fared better than the Big Ten
— TOM SPOUSTA




5:04 P.M.Kansas State Makes It a Game


Kansas State decided to play the second half of the Kansas State game.  They’ve followed a pitiful first half with a spirited second and have claimed the lead in the final quarter of this one.
They’ve cut down their turnovers, improved their shooting as well as their second chance opportunities. This was the game that was officially bumming me out the most in terms of my bracket choices, but the Wildcats have made this once extremely lopsided affair a true contest. 
— ZACH HILLESLAND




4:35 P.M.More Players Stepping Up


Shaquille Thomas is having himself quite the highlight party.  Shaking guys out of their socks, jumping out of his own… For a guy who only averages 2.8 points a game, and therefore theoretically less than or equal to only one highlight per game, Shaq T. is really having a blast. 
His boost has been absolutely necessary, as the Bearcats would be dead in the water without his efforts today. But so far, it’s still been too much McDermott for Cincinnati to handle.  McDermott is so good at using efficient moves to combat any lack of athleticism or size he has down low. He’s proving he’s a master of angles and timing, and both have played a huge part in his 23-point tally (so far) today.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




4:31 P.M.Indiana Off to Fast Start


Indiana’s Yogi Ferrell opened the game on a personal 9-0 run, exceeding his season average in just under four minutes.  
These are the kinds of sparks No. 1 seeds need throughout the tournament. You’ve been scouted relentlessly (hopefully) and there’s a lot of pressure, and play like that from Ferrell goes a long way to both sparking a top team and easing them into the rhythms of the game.  It also makes the other team think that their scouting report either isn’t up to par–or that they aren’t.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




4:32 P.M.Scott Gives Miami a Boost

Shane Larkin clearly is the floor general of these talented and veteran Hurricanes. But my new favorite guard — at least until someone shuts him down — is his backcourt mate, Durand Scott, a senior from the Bronx.
Especially after reading the following quick hits in his media bio: “Heart and soul of the Miami Hurricanes with a junkyard dog game … Uplifting personality makes him popular on campus and with campers … Slasher to the rim and for short floaters.”
Exactly.
Scott adds the spice and flamboyance that makes these two arguably the best guard tandem in the tourney. He drilled three consecutive 3 pointers in the second half, and after his third one dropped, he shrugged and smiled, then formed two circles around his eyes like he had just donned sharpshooting glasses.
Scott finished with 21 points on 6 of 10 shooting (5 of 8 from 3-point range) with 3 rebounds. Larkin had 10 points, 3 rebounds and 9 assists.
Combined, they made all 9 of their free throws.
Can’t wait till they meet Indiana in the East Regional final.
— TOM SPOUSTA




4:24 P.M.Rough Start for Kansas State


Kansas State had an abysmal first half against the No. 13 LaSalle Explorers. Sub-40 percent from the field, seven turnovers, six allowed made three-pointers… One of many recipes for an 18-point deficit. 
Most of these mid-seed/higher seed games have seemed completely flip-flopped in terms of team psychology.  The “little” guys are acting like big dogs, the bigger guys like house cats.  You really had to do your homework to get your bracket bulletproofed this year. 
— ZACH HILLESLAND




4:19 P.M.Creighton’s McDermott Impressive


Doug McDermott is adjusting nicely to the pace and physicality changes that Cincinnati has offered.  He’s looked a little off-balance at times, but for the most part has kept his bearings, confidence, and nose for the rim. 
McDermott has 17 points and 7 rebounds and there’s still more than 15 minutes to play. Coaches’ kids are always tough and McDermott no exception. He’s been demanding the ball, and this is just another game in need of winning to him. Doesn’t matter that it’s the tournament, you just get the feeling that he wants to win every game regardless of circumstance.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




3:51 P.M.Temple Advances


N.C. State threatened in the last stanza, the refs made several horrible calls affecting both sides, teams traded free throws, but Temple was able to hang on in a very strange and painfully slow final 30 seconds.
Temple’s Khalif Wyatt finished the game with 29 points, including a pair of late free throws as part of a 10-12 showing at the stripe.  N.C. State won the battle in nearly every statistical category, except for trips to the line and number or turnovers, two very important stat groups this time of year.

3:37 P.M.Cincinnati’s Rubles Teaching Creighton About Rebounding


Cincinnati’s Titus Rubles (another fantastic name) is extremely busy putting on a Big East rebounding lesson for the Creighton Bluejays. 
Rubles has been all over the offensive boards, being extremely physical and active down low.  On one particular play, he ripped two offensive boards from Creighton grasps and looked demonstrative doing so. I always thought that the Big East let their players play more physically on the boards, and so far the refs have let them play today.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




3:32 P.M.Creighton’s Echenique Here to Wake You Up



Photo

I’ve had my eyebrows raised for the last two minutes, and it’s because of a play just executed by Creighton big man Gregory Echenique.
First, he’s wearing pink shoes, which I think is another strong move in terms of taunting and player psychology.
Second, he’s wearing corrective goggles, which is an honest admission of ocular deficiency.
Third, he just performed a drop-step, left-handed thunder smash in traffic. It’s not a play you see much in college, and not even that much in the professional ranks either.  The best example ever of this is undoubtedly Hakim Warrick’s college dunk several years ago against Notre Dame.  It is to this day still the most impressive feat of basketball athleticism and length that I have ever seen.  
Echenique made me think for a second “I can’t possibly be watching Creighton,” but it just goes to show how much ability and potential and skill exists at some of these smaller programs.  And we’re not even talking about Doug McDermott.  
Creighton winning in a close one. 
— ZACH HILLESLAND




3:29 P.M.McDermott Starts Strong for Creighton


All eyes are on Creighton’s Doug McDermott here in Philadelphia, and for good reason: he enters the game with the country’s most impressive stat line: 23.1 points per game on 56.1 percent shooting, including 49.7 percent from 3-point range, and 7.5 rebounds. He has displayed his scoring prowess against Cincinnati with a pair of nifty moves around the basket.
But the Blue Jays have gotten a lift from an unexpected source in the early going. Ethan Wragge, a 6-7 forward, has come off the bench to drill a pair of long 3-pointers to keep Cincinnati’s aggressive defense at bay. Wragge is a capable scorer; he had 15 against Wichita State in the Missouri Valley Conference tournament final. Creighton leads, 14-12, midway through the first half.

3:17 P.M.Temple Reining In the Wolfpack

Temple has done a good job of keeping N.C. State at bay. I also just realized that I don’t know what it means to keep something “at bay.” I know what it means, but what did it originally mean? Who was the first person to keep something at bay? Is that a naval reference? Google time…
“It’s that last, “howling dog,” sense of “bay” that gave us “at bay.” When “bay” first appeared in this sense in English around 1300, it meant the chorus of howling barks of a pack of hunting hounds in hot pursuit of their prey. (This “bay” as “howling bark” also is used in the phrase “baying at the moon,” which some dogs lacking access to television are known to do.)” (some random Internet forum, circa 2011)
O.K.… So all I learned is that I’m a dog that has access to television.
Meanwhile…. Temple continues to keep N.C. State at arm’s length (this one makes sense). With less than eight to go, N.C. State is going to have to string together a couple of defensive stops and get back into transition or start getting hot from deep. 
— ZACH HILLESLAND




3:16 P.M.Miami Looks Focused

Miami is up, 40-19, at halftime.
No worry about a letdown against a lesser foe here. The ‘Canes look as focused as when they cut down the A.C.C. tournament nets.
They pounded Pacific with an array of lobs for dunks and lay-ins. Nine players have scored, led by Shane Larkin’s 10 points and 5 assists (dad Barry and family are here, sitting behind the Miami bench).
It’s already ugly, and not just because Pacific fans are riding the refs with ridiculous comments (not to be shared here). Tigers shot 29 percent and were 0 for 9 during one stretch.
— TOM SPOUSTA




3:04 P.M.Another Big East Team Joins the Action


I always love seeing big-time scorers from small-time schools go up against teams from power conferences, and that’s exactly what we’re blessed with in the Cincinnati-Creighton game. Doug McDermott averages just under 24 points per game and scores in a variety of ways. So it’s not quite a David vs. Goliath setup but it’s somewhat akin to that. 
He hasn’t touched the ball much early on, but when he has he has made strong and convincing moves and attacks. His first basket was created by a strong drive down the heart of Cincinnati’s defense, capped with an acrobatic finish, something I didn’t know McDermott had in his arsenal.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




3:01 P.M.N.C. State Alive and Well


N.C. State is having an uptick in vital signs for the first time this afternoon. For most of this game, Temple has been absolutely slapping the Wolfpack around, but thanks to an increase in tempo, N.C. State has been able to get out into transition and use its athleticism. A 16-point halftime lead has been cut in half in less than seven minutes. That’s exactly the kind of start N.C. State needed to give itself a fighting chance. Time for Temple to respond, or risk suffering another body blow from the Wolfpack.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




2:57 P.M.Miami Looking Good Early


Miami looks absolutely terrific so far against Pacific. The Hurricanes are playing with energy, poise and just the right amount of flash. It’s the kind of flash that isn’t gratuitous in any way, but instead displays all the different ways in which they can attack and dissect a defense. Shane Larkin has been doing it all – 7 points, 5 assists, 3 steals and 2 rebounds just for good measure. I have these guys in the title game, and so far I’m pleased with what I’m seeing.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




2:53 P.M.Wisconsin Falls


Wisconsin ended up being no match for Henderson-led Ole Miss. The Badgers couldn’t muster any offense down the stretch, and the Ole Miss sharpshooter came to life just in time to make this a relatively easy win down the stretch. Henderson is a very dangerous player in a tournament like this. As we saw on Day 1, shooting comes at a premium for a lot of these teams. Different arenas, different shooting backgrounds, different balls and nerves all play roles. But Henderson is a shooter through and through. He’s going to keep shooting until he misplaces his right hand, and even if he does that he’ll probably keep shooting.

2:43 P.M.O’Brien Leads the Owls


Temple started forward Jake O’Brien, instead of Anthony Lee, who has been battling a hip injury. O’Brien, who transferred from Boston University last summer, carried the Owls in the first half against N.C. State, with 13 points (3 of 5 from 3-point range) and 4 rebounds. The students serenaded him with “Jake O’Buckets” heading into the locker room at halftime, and, as a 6-foot-9 forward who can pull out and shoot it, he has been problematic for N.C. State so far. The ninth-seeded Owls lead, 38-22, at halftime.

Ole Miss is going to win this game unless Wisconsin can find its own 3-point maestro. Ole Miss has been methodically scoring, hitting free throws and benefiting from an improved Marshall Henderson. Henderson has shot himself out of his first-half slump, and now it’s almost as if it never happened. Certainly doesn’t look like he remembers. With just over a minute to go, Wisconsin is in serious trouble, down by 7.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




2:25 P.M.Wisconsin and Ole Miss Going Down to Wire


This one is going to go down to the final ticks it seems, Ole Miss clinging to a 4-point lead with just over three minutes to go. Wisconsin has done a good job of making this as ugly a game as it usually plays,  and it’s going to come down to which team can generate enough offense down the stretch. Ole Miss knows where to get its offense, Wisconsin seems to be searching a bit.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




2:30 P.M.Pacific, Miami Set to Tip Off

Here we go from Austin, where “Beware of Meat Sweats” should be listed on the menu at Stubbs Bar-B-Q …  
The University of the Pacific Tigers mascot just saluted me and gave a high-five and a couple of cheerleaders said, “Hi, go Tigers!” Miami and Pacific seem to have an equal number of fans here. Should the No. 15-seed Tigers threaten in any way, you can bet the neutral observers will jump behind the underdog. It’s one of the cool things about these early round games.     
— TOM SPOUSTA




2:24 P.M.Duke to Advance


Save for a comeback of truly epic proportions, it looks like Duke will indeed advance. It wasn’t exactly comfortable, but it wasn’t all that uncomfortable either. A very mature and well-executed game plan by the Blue Devils never really had this one in doubt, and Albany put up a respectable fight. In the end, just too much talent from the likes of Curry and Plumlee for Albany to handle. 




2:12 P.M.Henderson Keeps Firing


On his 635th shot of the game, the real Marshall Henderson finally stood up. It took two shots on the possession, but the second one was as true as can be, and it has Henderson fired up, and has led to a quick little Ole Miss run that has them out in front. 
Ole Miss has switched to man-to-man and has the Badgers completely out of sync. This game is definitely trending the way of Ole Miss. If Henderson even hits one more three in the next stretch, watch out. Could be another five-seed dropping early from the tournament.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




2:05 P.M.Bracket Busters


My 5/12’s and 8/9’s have been absolutely slaughtering my bracket, Temple being the latest bracket monster. They’re smacking N.C. State around, shooting a hot 13-of-19 from the field, including 4-of-6 from 3-point range. N.C. State looks out of sync on the offensive end and could use some kind of leadership to draw their focus back to the task at hand.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




2:04 P.M.Wisconsin in Dangerous Territory

The Badgers still quite haven’t figured out how to attack Ole Miss’ 2-3 zone, and Marshall Henderson still hasn’t quite figured out how to shoot in this building. I have the feeling that whichever problem is solved first might be the definitive swing in this game. 
Henderson is getting good looks, but has drawn back iron on several of his shots. Wisconsin still hasn’t found a way to consistently get inside against the zone, but have been able to get some points in transition. They need to get the ball into the high post and work from there, instead of relying on cross-court skip passes to relieve pressure.

Albany Coach Will Brown had plenty of reasons to be concerned about his team’s opening-round matchup. There was Duke’s history, and Duke’s size, and Duke’s talent. The list went on, but he cited one factor that weighed on him in particular: the revenge factor.
Last season, as a No. 2 seed, Duke fell to No. 15 Lehigh in one of the tournament’s most improbable upsets — ever. Before Friday’s game here. Brown said he wished that had not happened. “Lehigh didn’t do us any favors, that’s for sure,” Brown said.
Duke, once again a No. 2 seed, looked prepared this time around. The Blue Devils are up, 50-36, as things are edging toward the danger zone for the Great Danes and their yellow sneakers. Duke’s Seth Curry, a handful on the perimeter, has 17 points.
— SCOTT CACCIOLA




1:50 P.M.Quicker Pace Benefits Duke


A quicker-paced start to this second half has benefited the more efficient Blue Devils. Albany has hit some difficult shots to keep this one respectable, but we’re getting into that territory where you feel like it’s just a matter of time until Duke completely blows this one open. Seth Curry has continued his hot shooting, and overall the Duke team appears to be playing with a sizable amount of confidence and swagger. No-look passes from big guys, from point guards, all good and necessary. Meanwhile, Albany seems to be running out of steam while Duke is just picking it up.

Henderson misfired on the previous possession. But Ole Miss only  trails 25-22. And Badgers fans beware:  The Rebels are a second-half  team.

Albany certainly isn’t laying down in this one, but it doesn’t really seem like Duke has been disturbed by anything it has seen. The Blue Devils have been very even keel and businesslike throughout the first half, and while they certainly haven’t jumped out to quite the lead they were going for, they’re still very much in control.

Well, this is getting interesting. Albany’s Jacob Iati just nailed a 3-pointer in transition to cut Duke’s lead to 31-23 with about two minutes left in the first half. Coach K: not happy, calls timeout. If the Iati name sounds familiar, there’s a reason. In 2006, Iati’s older brother was part of the Albany team that nearly upended heavily favored Connecticut in the first round of the tournament, right here in this very same building. (Back then, it was the Wachovia Center.) The Great Danes are clearly hoping for some similar Iati magic this time around.
— SCOTT CACCIOLA




12:55 P.M.Wisconsin Struggling with 2-3 Zone


The 2-3 zone of Ole Miss is giving Wisconsin all sorts of fits. The Badgers haven’t been able to penetrate the gaps, and have had to settle for poor outside looks. They were able to get an offensive board on one possession (one of the weaknesses of a zone) but will have to either shoot Ole Miss out of it, or find a way to attack those gaps and find some penetration.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




12:51 P.M.No Pushovers



Photo

Albany: hanging around, hanging around. One thing that seems clear in the early rounds of the tournament this year (with a handful of notable exceptions, like Montana) is that 15 and 16 seeds simply are not intimidated by the atmosphere or by their opponents. That was not always the case, of course. Call it parity, or diluted talent at college basketball’s top ranks — few teams are pushovers in the N.C.A.A. tournament.
That said, one of the major issues for Albany is size. Duke, which leads 24-16, is 9 of 12 from the field. The Blue Devils are getting too many easy shots, while Albany has to fight for every single open look at the other end. All that hard work could have a cumulative effect. Albany doesn’t have tremendous depth.
— SCOTT CACCIOLA




12:46 P.M.Mixed Reaction for Henderson


Mostly cheers, some boos, for polarizing Ole Miss guard Marshall Henderson in introductions. The Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo., is about a third full, with probably as many Kansas fans as those from Wisconsin. (The Jayhawks play Friday night.) Henderson then misses his first two shots, a 3-pointer and a driving layup off a fast break. 
— PAT BORZI




12:46 P.M.Wisconsin and Ole Miss Under Way

Well, this was my 5-12 upset pick, and looking at how things went Thursday, it will probably prove to be an idiotic choice, unless this is the year where all No. 5 seeds lose in the first round. 
Not a great start for Ole Miss. Forced shots and a lack of flow have defined their offensive “attack” and it’s making them look unprepared for this methodical Wisconsin team.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




12:38 P.M.Seth Curry Ready to Play


Seth Curry looks a lot more like Dell, but still shoots as well as his brother. He has a quick 9 points in this one, all on jumpers, and he has looked incredibly smooth doing so. I’ve often wondered how the DNA pedigree plays a role in the drafting of players. You’ve seen several sibling pairs in the N.B.A. over the years, and it seems to be increasing. I wonder if general managers are more likely to take a risk on a player because he has a proven sibling. I think the answer has to be yes. I needed a brother.
— ZACH HILLESLAND




12:38 P.M.The Danes Hang In

Give the Albany Great Danes, with their matching mustard-yellow sneakers, a lot of credit in the early going here at Wells Fargo Center. You might have heard about Duke’s recent tournament history — does Lehigh ring a bell? — and the Blue Devils seemed determined to obliterate Albany after the opening tip by trapping in the half court and getting the ball inside to Mason Plumlee, Duke’s national player of the year candidate.
But Albany has hung around — at least for four-plus minutes. A 3-pointer from Peter Hooley, one of three Australians on Albany’s roster, cut Duke’s lead to 8-5 heading into the first media timeout. Word of the day so far? Scrappy. Not certain how long this team can keep it up, though. Duke has too much size and experience.

There needs to be a steeper penalty for flopping. The block/charge annoys me enough as it is, but when I see someone taller than six feet flopping, I want to put a sword through my television. The only thing making this O.K. is that I have yet to acquire a sword. 
But it’s one of my least favorite things about watching Duke and it’s how I know I would never draft certain players. If you’re a big man, don’t flop. Have some self-respect. Play defense. Stop begging for mercy.   Your ancestors are embarrassed.

12:26 P.M.Unfortunate Common Threads


Is there an N.C.A.A. mandate that all low seeds have to wear ugly jerseys? Two days in a row now, I’ve had to watch little-known teams dressed as Easter eggs, and while it is putting me in the mood for candy, it is stressing my eyes and sensibilities.

12:24 P.M.Great Starting Strategy by Duke


I love how Duke and Coach K have decided to start this game. They’re going with intense defensive pressure and overall high energy. I think that’s one of the best things you can do as a highly seeded team. I think there’s a tendency sometimes for teams to try to act too cool for school, and by doing so instill confidence in the underdogs and let them hang around. I thought that was part of Gonzaga’s problem Thursday. They were almost too polite. No. 1s aren’t supposed to be polite. They need to be mean. Duke is trying. Good for them.
— ZACH HILLESLAND


The second day of the 2013 N.C.A.A. Tournament forever will be remembered for 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast’s shocking upset of No. 2 seed Georgetown – just the seventh win by a No. 15 seed in tourney history. The stunner came in F.G.C.U.’s first-ever tourney game. (And, hey, how soon will we be hearing “Hey, why don’t we play football?” talk from some F.G.C.U. folks.)There were five other upsets Friday, as well: No. 9 Temple over North Carolina State, No. 10 Iowa State over Notre Dame, No. 11 Minnesota over UCLA, No. 12 Ole Miss over Wisconsin and No. 13 La Salle over Kansas State. Interestingly, four of the six upsets (all but Temple’s and La Salle’s) had double-digit victory margins.In all, there were 10 upsets in the tourney’s first round (two of those were No. 9s beating No. 8s). The biggest damage has come in the West Region, where half the upsets have occurred. When the second round gets under way Saturday, the region will be without the No. 3 (New Mexico), No. 4 (Kansas State), No. 5 (Wisconsin), No. 7 (Notre Dame) and No. 8 (Pitt) seeds. And top-seeded Gonzaga barely escaped Thursday against Southern.There were two upsets apiece in the East and South regions and just one in the Midwest, which was considered the strongest of the four regions. The East is missing its No. 5 and 8 seeds; the South its No. 2 and 6 seeds; and the Midwest its No. 5 seed.In terms of remaining conference representatives, the Big Ten – which had seven selections – leads with six. The Atlantic 10 has all five of its selections left. The A.C.C., Big East and Pac-12 each have three left, while the Big 12, Missouri Valley, Mountain West and S.E.C. have two each. The Atlantic Sun, Conference USA, Ivy and West Coast have one apiece.The Big East has been the biggest disappointment, with five of its eight selections already gone from the tourney. One overriding theme: The Big East’s losing teams lacked top-flight athleticism.— MIKE HUGUENINU.C.L.A. cut the lead to five early in the second half, but it was all Minnesota after that as the 11th-seeded Golden Gophers rolled to a 20-point win. In what almost certainly was his last college game, Bruins freshman Shabazz Muhammad scored 20 points but on 6-of-18 shooting. The Bruins shot 32.3 percent as a team.— MIKE HUGUENINKansas is going to close out 16th-seeded Western Kentucky from the foul line, and while the Jayhawks were far from dominant — far, far from dominant — the idea in March is to survive and advance and the Jayhawks did that. But Kansas better had show up with a better effort Sunday when it plays offense-minded North Carolina. K.U. should be able to hammer U.N.C. in the lane, but Kansas’ backcourt could be in trouble.— MIKE HUGUENIN
Pleasing a hugely pro-Jayhawks crowd in Kansas City, Kansas has opened a 10-point lead with a bit less than four minutes left against 16th-seeded Western Kentucky. The Hilltoppers seemingly have forgotten how to shoot in the second half. — MIKE HUGUENINWestern Kentucky’s hopes for an epic upset of top-seeded Kansas probably just ended with the fifth foul on Hilltoppers forward George Fant, who was one of two Western players in double figures. Kansas leads 48-42 with about five minutes left. Western has scored just 11 second-half points.— MIKE HUGUENINSeventh-seeded Notre Dame fell to Iowa State, 76-58, and the Fighting Irish’s performance put a capper on a dismal first-round performance by the Big East. The conference had eight teams selected for the field, but just three remain (Louisville, Marquette and Syracuse). To add to the misery, three league teams lost to worse-seeded squads (No. 2 Georgetown to No. 15 Florida Gulf Coast, Notre Dame to Iowa State and No. 8 Pitt to No. 9 Wichita State). And if No. 14 Davidson hadn’t melted down in the final minute, it would’ve taken out No. 3 Marquette. The other league losers were Cincinnati and Villanova.Also worth noting: The three Big East winners beat teams from low-major leagues (Louisville over North Carolina A&T from the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Syracuse over Montana from the Big Sky and Marquette over Davidson from the Southern).Final: 76-58 #IowaState runs #NotreDame out of UD Arena. Just a throttling from start to finish. #Cyclones might just give Ohio State a test— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13— MIKE HUGUENINWas looking forward to the U.C.L.A. dance team’s routine at halftime. But like the Bruins, it stalled when the wrong music was cued up. The dancers recovered nicely. Now we’ll see if the players do.U.C.L.A. shot 26 percent (8 of 30) as Minnesota took a 35-25 lead behind a nice mix of man and zone defenses. Austin Hollins had 11 for the Gophers, who got hot after a foul-plauged start. They shot 46 percent (14 of 30).If Minnesota wins, this will have to stand as the high drama in Austin. Top seeds Miami and Florida won impressively. Illinois just won.— TOM SPOUSTAMinnesota was one of the best teams in the nation early, starting the season 15-1. But the Golden Gophers were barely mediocre in the second half of the season, losing 11 of their final 16 games; they had lost three in a row and five of seven heading into the N.C.A.A. tourney.Minnesota looks to have found a salve for its woes, playing sixth-seeded U.C.L.A. tonight. The Golden Gophers lead by 10 at halftime. They have shot the ball well, and have put the clamps on the Bruins. U.C.L.A. has hit just 26 percent from the field and star forward Shabazz Muhammad is 0-of-7 from the field.Thing is, U.C.L.A. has been pitiful, yet is within striking distance. And Minnesota showed in the second half of the season that it is far from a sure thing.— MIKE HUGUENINIowa State is spanking seventh-seeded Notre Dame, leading by 16 with seven minutes gone in the second half. The Cyclones enjoy a huge advantage in athleticism and the Irish look overmatched.Georges Niang, a high-school teammate of Nerlens Noel at Tilton, leading the #Cyclones w/ 15 points. #Irish trailing, 53-35— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13— MIKE HUGUENINThere is no fathomable reason to expect 16th-seeded Western Kentucky to take down top-seeded Kansas, especially in Kansas City. But Western actually leads 31-30 at halftime.Western is 20-15 overall and finished fourth in the East Division of the relatively low-rent Sun Belt Conference before getting hot and winning the conference tourney title. In its one game against a power-conference foe that made the N.C.A.A. field, Western lost by 23 to Louisville on Dec. 22. And this is a team that was swept this season by Florida Atlantic; not Florida or even Florida Gulf Coast – Florida Atlantic.The athletic Hilltoppers are shooting 46 percent from the field and have outrebounded the taller Jayhawks, 18-11. In addition, Western has done a great defensive job on Kansas guard Ben McLemore, who has just two points. Western has thrown a variety of defensive looks at the Jayhawks, who don’t seem fully engaged in the contest.— MIKE HUGUENINOklahoma and San Diego State looked evenly matched on paper, and it has been that way on the court, too. The 10th-seeded Sooners lead 33-31 at halftime; the winner faces Florida Gulf Coast on Sunday.Sooners coach Lon Kruger is the first coach to take five schools to the N.C.A.A. tourney; he previously attended the Dance with Kansas State, Florida, Illinois and U.N.L.V.— MIKE HUGUENINNo. 10 seed Iowa State has received balanced scoring and is wreaking havoc with its defense in taking a 35-23 halftime lead on Notre Dame. The Irish look slow and plodding against the Cyclones, who have seven steals and have forced 14 turnovers.Clyburn with a 3 at the buzzer to give #ISU a 35-23 lead going into halftime. The #Cyclones are pumped up— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13— MIKE HUGUENINSo does defense still win championships, or is there just some bad basketball being played here in Austin?Except for Florida of course. The Gators just held Northwestern State, the nation’s highest scoring team (81 points per game) to 15 points in the second half in a 79-47 rout. Florida, though, does play defense, allowing the third fewest points in the country this season. “I wasn’t really pleased with our defense in the first half,” said Gators Coach Billy Donovan. “They shot too high of a percentage.”That wasn’t a problem for Illinois. The Illini earlier Friday scored only 20 points in the second half. And won by 8.And now we bring you the No. 6-seed UCLA Bruins vs. the No. 11 Minnesota Golden Gophers. If you took higher seeded UCLA, you took the underdog. Minnesota is favored by about 3 points. Hey, this could be a good one, you say.Five minutes into the nightcap, it’s Gophers 2, Bruins 0.Ugh.  — TOM SPOUSTAThe Kansas-Western Kentucky game, at least early, is looking a lot like Thursday’s Gonzaga-Southern 1-16 matchup. As with Southern, Western Kentucky is athletic, playing some junk defenses and is fearless going to the basket. Southern was able to hang close all game. Given that Kansas basically is playing a home game in Kansas City, it seems unlikely that Western can do the same. Then again, if tourney neophyte Florida Gulf Coast can beat Georgetown, why can’t Western — a mid-major blue-blood — do the same to Kansas?— MIKE HUGUENINDepending on which forecast you trust, four to eight inches of snow are expected in Kansas City from late Saturday into Sunday. It shouldn’t cripple the city but will make things messy for folks driving in for Sunday’s games, so Dan Gavitt, son of the late Dave Gavitt and the NCAA’s vice president of men’s basketball championships, issued this statement minutes ago:“We are monitoring the weather situation on the ground and in our tournament control center and are fully prepared. We do not anticipate any game delays.“Prior to the tournament, all venues submit emergency management plans to the NCAA national office for review. During the tournament, NCAA onsite coordinators are in regular contact with facility management at every venue to manage any situation that may arise.“In Kansas City, all of the teams and officials are already onsite. We are exploring extending their hotel stays if their travel is delayed after the games because of inclement weather.“This region routinely has winter snow and has the appropriate equipment and procedures to manage these winter conditions.“We encourage fans planning to attend games to pay attention to the weather, use good judgment and follow any directions from local authorities regarding travel and weather.”I think I can sum this up in four words: Be smart. Carry on.— PAT BORZIKansas looks a bit distracted in its 1-16 matchup with Western Kentucky. The top-seeded Jayhawks lead by just two at the second TV timeout. Western is athletic but usually is a poor shooting team.— MIKE HUGUENINIf you’re feeling a bit tired after a long day of watching the tourney, an easy way to wake up is to tune in to the Iowa State-Notre Dame contest. For some reason, Notre Dame thinks it is smart to again wear neon-green shoes and socks. Geez. On a big screen in HD, viewers might just go blind.Can’t get into Notre Dame’s neon flare. I feel like I’m watching Space Jam, or something else from the early 90s.— Justin Sablich (@JSablichNYT) 23 Mar 13— MIKE HUGUENINWow. Jackson Simmons missed three straight foul shots for Carolina, two with 11 seconds to play, then the first of two with 8.3 seconds.  Still that looked like enough, and it was. Carolina wins, 78-71. If Kansas can knock off Western Kentucky next, Roy Williams will face the Jayhawks for the third time in the NCAA Tournament. He lost the first
two, most recently last year.— PAT BORZIFlorida’s defense decided to show up in the second half and the Gators are mauling 15th-seeded Northwestern State (La.). Northwestern State scored 32 in the first half but has managed just 11 in 14 minutes of second-half play. Florida leads by 26.— MIKE HUGUENINNorth Carolina withstood a mid-game lull and got past Villanova 78-71. The Wildcats dominated in the paint but couldn’t handle the Tar Heels’ perimeter players.The Tar Heels almost certainly will play Kansas in the next round (the top-seeded Jayhawks have Western Kentucky later tonight). While Heels coach Roy Williams (who earned his 700th victory with the win) has been gone from Kansas for 10 seasons, there still almost assuredly would be a few tears shed by Ol’ Roy regardless of the outcome if the Heela and Jayhawks meet.— MIKE HUGUENINThe announcement of No. 2 seed Georgetown’s demise was met with loud cheers here, mostly from No. 3 Forida fans. The Gators, like the Hoyas, were put in the South Regional, which leads regional final next weekend in Arlington, Tex., at Cowboys Stadium. Florida would have met Georgetown if the seeds had held.Florida’s talent and depth has shown up and the Gators are pulling away from Northwestern State. Four players, led by Erik Murphy’s 16 points, have already scored in double figures. Casey Prather just dunked on a semi-fast break to put Florida ahead 63-42 with 8 minutes left.After Georgetown defeat, Florida now has about a 40 percent chance to reach Final 4, according to @fivethirtyeight //t.co/TQXYO1Kp0Q— NYT Sports Live (@NYTSportsLive) 23 Mar 13— TOM SPOUSTABack-to-back North Carolina turnovers allowed Villanova to score six  straight points to cut the Tar Heel lead to 67-66. But Marcus Paige’s 3-pointer and two foul shots kept Carolina in front. Now it’s 72-68
with under a minute to play.— PAT BORZIFlorida Gulf Coast’s victory was the seventh time a No. 15 seed has won a tourney game since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Three of those wins have come in the past two tourneys. None of the 15s has won a second game.Cheers in Dayton when scoreboard shows Georgetown’s loss. The stands are still full here, despite a 29-point #Buckeyes lead w/ 3 min— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13— MIKE HUGUENINOhio State is putting the finishing touches on a dismantling of No. 15-seed Iona in front what was essentially a home crowd here in Dayton, Ohio. Physically, the Gaels were just completely outmatched by the Buckeyes. They needed to shoot it lights out to be able to hang in, and they did not. Not even close. 33 percent. And, with 5 minutes remaining, Ohio State has as many assists as Iona has field goals (20)— ZACH SCHONBRUNGoing into the tourney, Florida Gulf Coast was a nice, quirky little story. The Eagles are in just their second season of full Division I eligibility and their coach, ex-NBA assistant Andy Enfield, is married to a former model who graced the covers of magazine such as Maxim and Elle. But come on – a team that was swept by a 12-win Lipscomb team was going to hang with second-seeded Georgetown? Yes, F.G.C.U. did beat Miami, but it also lost 10 games.Well, the 15th-seeded Eagles – who finished second in the Atlantic Sun in the regular season – have pulled the shocker of the tourney, stunning the Hoyas – who won a share of the Big East title – with a 78-68 decision.In busting brackets everywhere, Florida Gulf Coast also opened up the South Region. Georgetown was seen as a legit threat to top-seeded Kansas, but now third-seeded Florida (assuming the Gators continue to fend off Northwestern State), fourth-seeded Michigan and fifth-seeded V.C.U. have to have big smiles.— MIKE HUGUENINThere’s 7:57 to play at the Sprint Center, North Carolina leads 54-50, and they’re showing highlights of the Florida Gulf Coast-Georgetown game. Out of town scores are hard to read in the arena, and fans without smartphones just gasped at the score.— PAT BORZIThe cheers of North Carolina fans drowned out the boos from Kansas fans when ex-Jayhawks Coach Roy Williams was introduced before the Tar Heels played Villanova, but the booers may have the last laugh.  Carolina has blown a 20-point first half lead and trails 55-54 with 12:26 to play. Kansas has the next game, with their almost all their fans fans in their seats now, the last few minutes ought to be a hoot.— PAT BORZIVillanova trailed North Carolina by 17 early, but the Wildcats have continued to grind and now lead, 44-42, six minutes into the second half. Villanova really has clamped down on defense against the Heels, who never will be mistaken for a physical team.— MIKE HUGUENINOhio State looks to have taken control of its 2-15 matchup against Iona, opening up a 19-point lead early in the second half. But 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast continues to lead against Georgetown; the Eagles own a 59-45 advantage with a bit less than eight minutes left in the game. The Eagles are getting excellent play from sophomore point guard Brett Comer, who has 10 points and eight assists and hasn’t been fazed by Georgetown’s defense. Comer is used to playing with high-profile players: He was the backcourt mate of the New Orleans Hornets’ Austin Rivers for three seasons at Winter Park High in the Orlando suburbs.— MIKE HUGUENINNorthwestern State (La.) remains within striking distance of No. 3 Florida, trailing 40-32 at halftime. Northwestern is getting and hitting its shots, but Florida is scoring easily inside because of its height advantage. Frankly, if Gators center Patric Young had any offensive skills, Florida would be up by 14 or 15.— MIKE HUGUENINSay this for Northwestern State fans: they came prepared and have reason to cheer and talk a little trash. “This isn’t LSU, this is NSU baby!” one Demon fan shouted. He and several other Demons wielded toy tridents with stuffed Gators impaled on the end of them. They also wore purple shirts that read “Rise To The Occasion.” So far, NSU has. It’s Florida, 28-24, with 7:46 left in the first half. Coach Mike McConathy’s 5-man substitution waves haven’t really bothered the Gators, but NSU has set a solid pace and Florida has yet to find its gear.   And say this for Gator fans here: they look and sound nervous.— TOM SPOUSTAMaybe it’s time to believe in 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast. The school, located in Fort Myers, is in just its second season of full Division I eligibility, but it leads Georgetown by 13 with 14 minutes left. The Eagles scuffled some early, but they are just as athletic as the Hoyas and are playing extremely loose. Georgetown, meanwhile, lost as a No. 3 seed in the second round last season and is playing extremely tight.— MIKE HUGUENINBig things might be a-brewin’ in Philly. No. 15 seed Florida Gulf Coast leads Georgetown by eight at the first TV timeout of the second half. The Hoyas hit the wall offensively midway through the first half and now can’t score.— MIKE HUGUENINIona started full-court pressing to slow down Ohio State’s offense in the first half, after falling in a 27-8 hole. They managed to cut the lead down to 10 at the half. But the Buckeyes shot 52 percent and held Iona, the second-highest scoring team in the country, to just 33 points and 34 percent shooting. Iona hasn’t scored fewer than 62 points yet this season.#Iona heads into halftime trailing, 43-33. Went on a 25-10 run to cut the lead down to eight, but #Buckeyes still seem in control— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 23 Mar 13— ZACH SCHONBRUNNorth Carolina looked as if it was going to blow out Villanova, but the Wildcats started playing some defense and trail 37-29  at halftime against the Tar Heels. U.N.C. scored just seven points in the final 7:47 of the half.North Carolina played noticeably better basketball after switching to a small lineup in February, but Heels have been sloppy with the ball tonight (11 turnovers) and have only nine rebounds. Thing is, Villanova has 12 turnovers and the Heels were taking advantage of those early in the half.— MIKE HUGUENINIona looks to have weathered an early storm and is in the game against second-seeded Ohio State in Dayton. The Buckeyes jumped out to a big early lead, but the Gaels have settled in offensively and now trail by just eight with about two minutes left in the first half.— MIKE HUGUENINFlorida is one of the best defensive teams in the nation – the Gators rank second nationally in stats guru KenPom.com’s defensive efficiency ratings – but the Gators are having trouble with Northwestern State’s fast-paced attack. Third-seeded Florida leads 19-17 less than eight minutes into the game. Florida is scoring at will inside, but its defense is getting shredded.— MIKE HUGUENINNorth Carolina is torching Villanova in an 8-9 matchup, leading by 17 at the under-8-minute TV timeout. The Wildcats’ defense looks lost.— MIKE HUGUENINNo. 15 seed Florida Gulf Coast is shooting just 30 percent from the field and 46 percent from the line, but still leads second-seeded Georgetown, 24-22, at halftime. The Hoyas have made just 33 percent of their shots from the floor, including 1-of-8 from 3-point range, and 37 percent from the line.Only six No. 15s ever have won an N.C.A.A. tourney game, including two last year.With Florida Gulf Coast near an upset, here’s our story from the weekend. Most interesting team in the tourney: //t.co/hqtI3DsrTk— Greg Bishop (@nytbishop) 23 Mar 13— MIKE HUGUENINUnlike Georgetown, a No. 2 seed that is letting a No. 15 hang around, Ohio State is blitzing Iona. Playing in front of a virtual home crowd in Dayton, Ohio, the Buckeyes lead by 14 less than eight minutes into the game. Iona likes to run, but Ohio State’s defense is causing all sorts of problems for the Gaels.#Buckeyes are running and dunking here — or basically playing #Iona’s own game against them. 20-6— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 22 Mar 13— MIKE HUGUENINFlorida Gulf Coast has played inconsistent offense, but a 6-0 run has the Eagles – in just their second season as a full-fledged Division I member – trailing second-seeded Georgetown by just 18-17 with about seven minutes left in the first half.The Hoyas lost in the first round as a No. 3 seed last season, and while they have a decided height advantage over the Eagles, Florida Gulf Coast has been able to hang around because the Hoyas are shooting poorly.— MIKE HUGUENINNo wonder coaches and experts have been lamenting the demise of skill and fundamentals in college basketball. Exhibit A-whatever:  Illinois 57, Colorado 49.Good Lord. Calling this game mediocre would be kind.The Illini shot 13.6 percent (3 of 22) in the second half; the Buffs shot 32 percent (9 of 28). Illinois looked angry with itself as the final horn sounded, and aside from a few low-key high-fives, didn’t really celebrate. Colorado just looked defeated.Still, when Xavier Johnson nailed a 3-pointer from NBA range with 16.9 seconds left to pull within 55-49, it seemed like the Buffs had a chance.
Survive and advance was never more true than this one.— TOM SPOUSTASeventh-seeded Illinois had a poor offensive showing in the second half but still had enough to hold off Colorado, 57-49, and advances to play Miami. Illinois shot just 30 percent from the field for the game.— MIKE HUGUENINIllinois leads Colorado by four with 3:14 left, which means another close finish in a tourney that has had too few of those. Illinois’ offense has been brutal in the second half, but building a big first-half lead obviously has its advantages.— MIKE HUGUENINIt was an epic shooting slump. So cold and astounding that it was hard to turn away. Illinois just went 11 minutes, 27 seconds without scoring a basket, going 0 for 15 in that stretch.Nothing that Coach John Groce scribbled on his board during timeouts worked. And it’s not like the Buffs were playing lock down defense.
Tracy Abrams finally ended the drought with a lay up, but now Colorado leads 44-42.And now Illinois can’t miss, going on a mini-run to take a 48-44 lead with 5:58 to play. Ugly, but amazing.Welcome back to the tourney, Buffs.— TOM SPOUSTAIllinois just hit its first field goal of the second half — with 8:32 left in the game. The Illini trail Colorado by just three, though.— MIKE HUGUENINUnlike some other one-seeds (ahem, Gonzaga), Indiana takes care of business against James Madison with an 83-62 win that was never in doubt. Hoosiers shot 52 percent from the field and out-rebounded JMU, 39-24. Leading scorer: Yogi Ferrell, who scored 16 points with 7 rebounds and 6 assists. It will be Indiana vs. Temple on Sunday.— ZACH SCHONBRUNColorado has opened the second half with a 14-2 run and has cut IIllinois’ lead to four at the first T.V. timeout of the half. The Buffs had good defensive numbers this season, but they sure played lousy defense in the first half,. Illinois hasn’t hit a second-half field goal, and the Buffs are feeding off that on the offensive end. Colorado enjoys an advantage in athleticism, and coach Tad Boyle obviously told his players to use that advantage at halftime.— MIKE HUGUENINColorado has opened the second half with a 9-2 run against seventh-seeded Illinois and has cut the lead to nine. The Buffs have hit some 3-pointers to get back into it; now they have to get more physical on defense to stay in it.— MIKE HUGUENINVictor Oladipo, a candidate for national player of the year, has been quiet here against James Madison, with only 6 field goal attempts in the first 30 minutes of the game. He has been more of a facilitator, while Yogi Ferrell (14 points), Cody Zeller (11 points), Jordan Hulls and Will Sheehey (8 points each) lead the offense. Indiana’s depth and balance offensively has been on clear display. James Madison doesn’t know who to double team next.With Indiana ahead, 68-35, w/ 8 minutes left, the Temple team has left their seats. I think they’ve seen enough #Hoosiers #Owls— Zach Schonbrun (@zschonbrun) 22 Mar 13— ZACH SCHONBRUNIndiana is going to beat James Madison rather handily. The question is whether the Hoosiers can become the third team in this tourney to win by 40-plus points. I.U. leads by 33 midway through the second half and should become the fifth team to win by at least 29.Syracuse and V.C.U. each won by more than 40 on Thursday. Miami won by 29 earlier today and Louisville by 31 Thursday night.— MIKE HUGUENINLa Salle’s upset of fourth-seeded Kansas State means that for the third tournament in a row, there will be a 12-13 matchup in the round of 32; La Salle plays 12th-seeded Ole Miss on Sunday.In addition, although there was no 12-13 matchup in the 2010 tourney, Sunday’s game will be the sixth 12-13 contest in the past six tourneys; there were two in 2008.The bad news for La Salle (which already has won two games in this tourney, as it downed Boise State in a play-in game) is that the No. 12 seed is 4-1 against the No. 13. But that 13 win came last season, when Ohio downed U.S.F.As for Ole Miss, the Rebels were the third No. 12 seed to win in this tourney. But don’t necessarily think the No. 12s are Cinderella stories: Each is a power-conference school (Ole Miss is from the S.E.C., and the other two No. 12s to win – Cal and Oregon – are from the Pac-12).— MIKE HUGUENINIt’s Illinois 37-21 at halftime, and the Buffs are on the verge of getting blown out for one simple reason: guard play, the axiom for greatness in March. The Illini start three guards — D.J. Richardson, Brandon Paul and Tracy Abrams — and they controlled every aspect of the first half. They combined for 27 points on 9 of 19 shooting; Colorado’s backcourt of Askia Booker and Spencer Dinwiddie totaled just 8 points, going 2 of 9. Well, somebody from the Pac-12 eventually had to lose, and it looks like the Buffs are it.— TOM SPOUSTAYogi Ferrell followed up his hot start with a complete first half performance: 14 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists.  The rest of the scoring was quite balanced and the Hoosiers are looking every bit a number one seed.
I’m already getting anxious for a potential Indiana-Syracuse showdown in the Sweet 16.  Indiana is a better team with better psychological and emotional balance, but if Syracuse can properly orchestrate for one game, things could get very interesting.Much like yesterday, this tournament has thus far proven that only one-seeds and two-seeds are sacred. Everyone else is up for sacrifice, and game after game has shown seeding to be utterly inconsequential. My bracket hasn’t been this ugly since I was ten, and that’s only because I used crayons and glue that time.There are so many good games still to be played today but I’m already starting to fantasize about some of the weekend matchups. Michigan-V.C.U., Butler-Marquette, and Duke-Creighton have already started to wrinkle my brain. With that being said, Minnesota-U.C.L.A. and North Carolina-Villanova should provide enough action to keep me placated until then. — ZACH HILLESLANDJust had to share this after listening to Pacific Coach Bob Thomason following his team’s blowout loss to Miami. Thomason is retiring after 25 years as coach of his alma mater, and his post-game comments were among the classiest I’ve ever heard, any sport.After saying he had never been to Austin before, and thanking everybody for their hospitality, he continued: “I’d like to thank and congratulate Miami on advancing. Great team, great pieces, they played tremendous, shot the ball well, rebounded the ball well, played good defense. And I’ll be rooting for them the rest of the time. So maybe they can win a national championship. If I had to go out in coaching, you want to go out to a great team, but also to a great coach and a class coach, and Jim [Larranaga] is that.”— TOM SPOUSTAThey went back and forth in the final minute, but Creighton made enough free throws and Cincinnati’s Sean Kilpatrick had a potentially beautiful prayer go unanswered, and the Bluejays were able to hang on and advance.McDermott finished the day with 27 points and 11 rebounds, and Creighton heads off to the next round to play Duke. I can’t wait to watch that one. I wonder how much time Plumlee will spend on McDermott and vice versa.  In another down to the wire finish, LaSalle was able to hang on and win after they blew an 18-point lead in the second half. Kansas State’s Bruce Weber looked like he was absolutely on fire on the inside as he was walking through the handshake line.   That one will undoubtedly be a tough one to swallow.  The Wildcats hurt the most, my bracket next most.— ZACH HILLESLANDIt’s on in Austin.  Clearly, these two teams don’t like each other. “C’mon Big Ten” an Illinois fan shouted just before tip-off. And when an Illini player went to the foul line, Colorado fans countered with this clever chant: “Quiet! He’s shooting a free throw!””Quiet! He’s shooting a free throw!”And it’s only Illinois 16, Colorado 15 eight minutes into the game.The Frank Erwin Center here suddenly has the atmosphere of a college basketball game. Loud, proud, packed and the crowd obviously very aware that, so far, the Pac-12 has fared better than the Big Ten— TOM SPOUSTAKansas State decided to play the second half of the Kansas State game.  They’ve followed a pitiful first half with a spirited second and have claimed the lead in the final quarter of this one.They’ve cut down their turnovers, improved their shooting as well as their second chance opportunities. This was the game that was officially bumming me out the most in terms of my bracket choices, but the Wildcats have made this once extremely lopsided affair a true contest. — ZACH HILLESLANDShaquille Thomas is having himself quite the highlight party.  Shaking guys out of their socks, jumping out of his own… For a guy who only averages 2.8 points a game, and therefore theoretically less than or equal to only one highlight per game, Shaq T. is really having a blast. His boost has been absolutely necessary, as the Bearcats would be dead in the water without his efforts today. But so far, it’s still been too much McDermott for Cincinnati to handle.  McDermott is so good at using efficient moves to combat any lack of athleticism or size he has down low. He’s proving he’s a master of angles and timing, and both have played a huge part in his 23-point tally (so far) today.— ZACH HILLESLANDIndiana’s Yogi Ferrell opened the game on a personal 9-0 run, exceeding his season average in just under four minutes.  These are the kinds of sparks No. 1 seeds need throughout the tournament. You’ve been scouted relentlessly (hopefully) and there’s a lot of pressure, and play like that from Ferrell goes a long way to both sparking a top team and easing them into the rhythms of the game.  It also makes the other team think that their scouting report either isn’t up to par–or that they aren’t.— ZACH HILLESLANDShane Larkin clearly is the floor general of these talented and veteran Hurricanes. But my new favorite guard — at least until someone shuts him down — is his backcourt mate, Durand Scott, a senior from the Bronx.Especially after reading the following quick hits in his media bio: “Heart and soul of the Miami Hurricanes with a junkyard dog game … Uplifting personality makes him popular on campus and with campers … Slasher to the rim and for short floaters.”Exactly.Scott adds the spice and flamboyance that makes these two arguably the best guard tandem in the tourney. He drilled three consecutive 3 pointers in the second half, and after his third one dropped, he shrugged and smiled, then formed two circles around his eyes like he had just donned sharpshooting glasses.Scott finished with 21 points on 6 of 10 shooting (5 of 8 from 3-point range) with 3 rebounds. Larkin had 10 points, 3 rebounds and 9 assists.Combined, they made all 9 of their free throws.Can’t wait till they meet Indiana in the East Regional final.— TOM SPOUSTAKansas State had an abysmal first half against the No. 13 LaSalle Explorers. Sub-40 percent from the field, seven turnovers, six allowed made three-pointers… One of many recipes for an 18-point deficit. Most of these mid-seed/higher seed games have seemed completely flip-flopped in terms of team psychology.  The “little” guys are acting like big dogs, the bigger guys like house cats.  You really had to do your homework to get your bracket bulletproofed this year. — ZACH HILLESLANDDoug McDermott is adjusting nicely to the pace and physicality changes that Cincinnati has offered.  He’s looked a little off-balance at times, but for the most part has kept his bearings, confidence, and nose for the rim. McDermott has 17 points and 7 rebounds and there’s still more than 15 minutes to play. Coaches’ kids are always tough and McDermott no exception. He’s been demanding the ball, and this is just another game in need of winning to him. Doesn’t matter that it’s the tournament, you just get the feeling that he wants to win every game regardless of circumstance.— ZACH HILLESLANDN.C. State threatened in the last stanza, the refs made several horrible calls affecting both sides, teams traded free throws, but Temple was able to hang on in a very strange and painfully slow final 30 seconds.Temple’s Khalif Wyatt finished the game with 29 points, including a pair of late free throws as part of a 10-12 showing at the stripe.  N.C. State won the battle in nearly every statistical category, except for trips to the line and number or turnovers, two very important stat groups this time of year.— ZACH HILLESLANDThe Cincinnati uniforms have a real “credits from Saved By The Bell” kind of appeal. #ncaa #marchHUHness— Linda Holmes (@nprmonkeysee) 22 Mar 13Cincinnati’s Titus Rubles (another fantastic name) is extremely busy putting on a Big East rebounding lesson for the Creighton Bluejays. Rubles has been all over the offensive boards, being extremely physical and active down low.  On one particular play, he ripped two offensive boards from Creighton grasps and looked demonstrative doing so. I always thought that the Big East let their players play more physically on the boards, and so far the refs have let them play today.— ZACH HILLESLANDI’ve had my eyebrows raised for the last two minutes, and it’s because of a play just executed by Creighton big man Gregory Echenique.First, he’s wearing pink shoes, which I think is another strong move in terms of taunting and player psychology.Second, he’s wearing corrective goggles, which is an honest admission of ocular deficiency.Third, he just performed a drop-step, left-handed thunder smash in traffic. It’s not a play you see much in college, and not even that much in the professional ranks either.  The best example ever of this is undoubtedly Hakim Warrick’s college dunk several years ago against Notre Dame.  It is to this day still the most impressive feat of basketball athleticism and length that I have ever seen.  Echenique made me think for a second “I can’t possibly be watching Creighton,” but it just goes to show how much ability and potential and skill exists at some of these smaller programs.  And we’re not even talking about Doug McDermott.  Creighton winning in a close one. — ZACH HILLESLANDAll eyes are on Creighton’s Doug McDermott here in Philadelphia, and for good reason: he enters the game with the country’s most impressive stat line: 23.1 points per game on 56.1 percent shooting, including 49.7 percent from 3-point range, and 7.5 rebounds. He has displayed his scoring prowess against Cincinnati with a pair of nifty moves around the basket.But the Blue Jays have gotten a lift from an unexpected source in the early going. Ethan Wragge, a 6-7 forward, has come off the bench to drill a pair of long 3-pointers to keep Cincinnati’s aggressive defense at bay. Wragge is a capable scorer; he had 15 against Wichita State in the Missouri Valley Conference tournament final. Creighton leads, 14-12, midway through the first half.— SCOTT CACCIOLATemple has done a good job of keeping N.C. State at bay. I also just realized that I don’t know what it means to keep something “at bay.” I know what it means, but what did it originally mean? Who was the first person to keep something at bay? Is that a naval reference? Google time…“It’s that last, “howling dog,” sense of “bay” that gave us “at bay.” When “bay” first appeared in this sense in English around 1300, it meant the chorus of howling barks of a pack of hunting hounds in hot pursuit of their prey. (This “bay” as “howling bark” also is used in the phrase “baying at the moon,” which some dogs lacking access to television are known to do.)” (some random Internet forum, circa 2011)O.K.… So all I learned is that I’m a dog that has access to television.Meanwhile…. Temple continues to keep N.C. State at arm’s length (this one makes sense). With less than eight to go, N.C. State is going to have to string together a couple of defensive stops and get back into transition or start getting hot from deep. — ZACH HILLESLANDMiami is up, 40-19, at halftime.No worry about a letdown against a lesser foe here. The ‘Canes look as focused as when they cut down the A.C.C. tournament nets.They pounded Pacific with an array of lobs for dunks and lay-ins. Nine players have scored, led by Shane Larkin’s 10 points and 5 assists (dad Barry and family are here, sitting behind the Miami bench).It’s already ugly, and not just because Pacific fans are riding the refs with ridiculous comments (not to be shared here). Tigers shot 29 percent and were 0 for 9 during one stretch.— TOM SPOUSTAI always love seeing big-time scorers from small-time schools go up against teams from power conferences, and that’s exactly what we’re blessed with in the Cincinnati-Creighton game. Doug McDermott averages just under 24 points per game and scores in a variety of ways. So it’s not quite a David vs. Goliath setup but it’s somewhat akin to that. He hasn’t touched the ball much early on, but when he has he has made strong and convincing moves and attacks. His first basket was created by a strong drive down the heart of Cincinnati’s defense, capped with an acrobatic finish, something I didn’t know McDermott had in his arsenal.— ZACH HILLESLANDN.C. State is having an uptick in vital signs for the first time this afternoon. For most of this game, Temple has been absolutely slapping the Wolfpack around, but thanks to an increase in tempo, N.C. State has been able to get out into transition and use its athleticism. A 16-point halftime lead has been cut in half in less than seven minutes. That’s exactly the kind of start N.C. State needed to give itself a fighting chance. Time for Temple to respond, or risk suffering another body blow from the Wolfpack.— ZACH HILLESLANDMiami looks absolutely terrific so far against Pacific. The Hurricanes are playing with energy, poise and just the right amount of flash. It’s the kind of flash that isn’t gratuitous in any way, but instead displays all the different ways in which they can attack and dissect a defense. Shane Larkin has been doing it all – 7 points, 5 assists, 3 steals and 2 rebounds just for good measure. I have these guys in the title game, and so far I’m pleased with what I’m seeing.— ZACH HILLESLANDWisconsin ended up being no match for Henderson-led Ole Miss. The Badgers couldn’t muster any offense down the stretch, and the Ole Miss sharpshooter came to life just in time to make this a relatively easy win down the stretch. Henderson is a very dangerous player in a tournament like this. As we saw on Day 1, shooting comes at a premium for a lot of these teams. Different arenas, different shooting backgrounds, different balls and nerves all play roles. But Henderson is a shooter through and through. He’s going to keep shooting until he misplaces his right hand, and even if he does that he’ll probably keep shooting. President Obama’s 2013 NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament Bracket: Last year, President Obama predicted Baylor… //t.co/qOMOxHqKUU — White House Blog (@WhiteHouse_Blog) 22 Mar 13Temple started forward Jake O’Brien, instead of Anthony Lee, who has been battling a hip injury. O’Brien, who transferred from Boston University last summer, carried the Owls in the first half against N.C. State, with 13 points (3 of 5 from 3-point range) and 4 rebounds. The students serenaded him with “Jake O’Buckets” heading into the locker room at halftime, and, as a 6-foot-9 forward who can pull out and shoot it, he has been problematic for N.C. State so far. The ninth-seeded Owls lead, 38-22, at halftime.— ZACH SCHONBRUNOle Miss is going to win this game unless Wisconsin can find its own 3-point maestro. Ole Miss has been methodically scoring, hitting free throws and benefiting from an improved Marshall Henderson. Henderson has shot himself out of his first-half slump, and now it’s almost as if it never happened. Certainly doesn’t look like he remembers. With just over a minute to go, Wisconsin is in serious trouble, down by 7.— ZACH HILLESLANDThis one is going to go down to the final ticks it seems, Ole Miss clinging to a 4-point lead with just over three minutes to go. Wisconsin has done a good job of making this as ugly a game as it usually plays,  and it’s going to come down to which team can generate enough offense down the stretch. Ole Miss knows where to get its offense, Wisconsin seems to be searching a bit.— ZACH HILLESLANDHere we go from Austin, where “Beware of Meat Sweats” should be listed on the menu at Stubbs Bar-B-Q …  The University of the Pacific Tigers mascot just saluted me and gave a high-five and a couple of cheerleaders said, “Hi, go Tigers!” Miami and Pacific seem to have an equal number of fans here. Should the No. 15-seed Tigers threaten in any way, you can bet the neutral observers will jump behind the underdog. It’s one of the cool things about these early round games.     — TOM SPOUSTASave for a comeback of truly epic proportions, it looks like Duke will indeed advance. It wasn’t exactly comfortable, but it wasn’t all that uncomfortable either. A very mature and well-executed game plan by the Blue Devils never really had this one in doubt, and Albany put up a respectable fight. In the end, just too much talent from the likes of Curry and Plumlee for Albany to handle. On his 635th shot of the game, the real Marshall Henderson finally stood up. It took two shots on the possession, but the second one was as true as can be, and it has Henderson fired up, and has led to a quick little Ole Miss run that has them out in front. Ole Miss has switched to man-to-man and has the Badgers completely out of sync. This game is definitely trending the way of Ole Miss. If Henderson even hits one more three in the next stretch, watch out. Could be another five-seed dropping early from the tournament.— ZACH HILLESLANDMy 5/12’s and 8/9’s have been absolutely slaughtering my bracket, Temple being the latest bracket monster. They’re smacking N.C. State around, shooting a hot 13-of-19 from the field, including 4-of-6 from 3-point range. N.C. State looks out of sync on the offensive end and could use some kind of leadership to draw their focus back to the task at hand.— ZACH HILLESLANDThe Badgers still quite haven’t figured out how to attack Ole Miss’ 2-3 zone, and Marshall Henderson still hasn’t quite figured out how to shoot in this building. I have the feeling that whichever problem is solved first might be the definitive swing in this game. Henderson is getting good looks, but has drawn back iron on several of his shots. Wisconsin still hasn’t found a way to consistently get inside against the zone, but have been able to get some points in transition. They need to get the ball into the high post and work from there, instead of relying on cross-court skip passes to relieve pressure.— ZACH HILLESLANDAh, March Madness.  Or as the Northwestern basketball fan knows it, March.— Seth Meyers (@sethmeyers21) 21 Mar 13Back-to-back airballs by Traevon Jackson of the Badgers, the son of ex-N.B.A.-er Jim Jackson. The last time I saw somebody do that, I think it  was me.— PAT BORZIAlbany Coach Will Brown had plenty of reasons to be concerned about his team’s opening-round matchup. There was Duke’s history, and Duke’s size, and Duke’s talent. The list went on, but he cited one factor that weighed on him in particular: the revenge factor.Last season, as a No. 2 seed, Duke fell to No. 15 Lehigh in one of the tournament’s most improbable upsets — ever. Before Friday’s game here. Brown said he wished that had not happened. “Lehigh didn’t do us any favors, that’s for sure,” Brown said.Duke, once again a No. 2 seed, looked prepared this time around. The Blue Devils are up, 50-36, as things are edging toward the danger zone for the Great Danes and their yellow sneakers. Duke’s Seth Curry, a handful on the perimeter, has 17 points.— SCOTT CACCIOLAA quicker-paced start to this second half has benefited the more efficient Blue Devils. Albany has hit some difficult shots to keep this one respectable, but we’re getting into that territory where you feel like it’s just a matter of time until Duke completely blows this one open. Seth Curry has continued his hot shooting, and overall the Duke team appears to be playing with a sizable amount of confidence and swagger. No-look passes from big guys, from point guards, all good and necessary. Meanwhile, Albany seems to be running out of steam while Duke is just picking it up.— ZACH HILLESLANDA badass move for Harvard would be to just drop out the NCAA tournament voluntarily. That’s what Bill Gates would do.— Mike Birbiglia (@birbigs) 22 Mar 13Marshall Henderson wrapped up a miserable first half for Ole Miss — 1-for-11 from the field and 0-4 beyond the arc for two points. Twice  late in the half, Sam Dekker buried 3-pointers for Wisconsin after
Henderson misfired on the previous possession. But Ole Miss only  trails 25-22. And Badgers fans beware:  The Rebels are a second-half  team.— PAT BORZIAlbany certainly isn’t laying down in this one, but it doesn’t really seem like Duke has been disturbed by anything it has seen. The Blue Devils have been very even keel and businesslike throughout the first half, and while they certainly haven’t jumped out to quite the lead they were going for, they’re still very much in control.— ZACH HILLESLANDWell, this is getting interesting. Albany’s Jacob Iati just nailed a 3-pointer in transition to cut Duke’s lead to 31-23 with about two minutes left in the first half. Coach K: not happy, calls timeout. If the Iati name sounds familiar, there’s a reason. In 2006, Iati’s older brother was part of the Albany team that nearly upended heavily favored Connecticut in the first round of the tournament, right here in this very same building. (Back then, it was the Wachovia Center.) The Great Danes are clearly hoping for some similar Iati magic this time around.— SCOTT CACCIOLAThe 2-3 zone of Ole Miss is giving Wisconsin all sorts of fits. The Badgers haven’t been able to penetrate the gaps, and have had to settle for poor outside looks. They were able to get an offensive board on one possession (one of the weaknesses of a zone) but will have to either shoot Ole Miss out of it, or find a way to attack those gaps and find some penetration.— ZACH HILLESLANDAlbany: hanging around, hanging around. One thing that seems clear in the early rounds of the tournament this year (with a handful of notable exceptions, like Montana) is that 15 and 16 seeds simply are not intimidated by the atmosphere or by their opponents. That was not always the case, of course. Call it parity, or diluted talent at college basketball’s top ranks — few teams are pushovers in the N.C.A.A. tournament.That said, one of the major issues for Albany is size. Duke, which leads 24-16, is 9 of 12 from the field. The Blue Devils are getting too many easy shots, while Albany has to fight for every single open look at the other end. All that hard work could have a cumulative effect. Albany doesn’t have tremendous depth.— SCOTT CACCIOLAMostly cheers, some boos, for polarizing Ole Miss guard Marshall Henderson in introductions. The Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo., is about a third full, with probably as many Kansas fans as those from Wisconsin. (The Jayhawks play Friday night.) Henderson then misses his first two shots, a 3-pointer and a driving layup off a fast break. — PAT BORZIWell, this was my 5-12 upset pick, and looking at how things went Thursday, it will probably prove to be an idiotic choice, unless this is the year where all No. 5 seeds lose in the first round. Not a great start for Ole Miss. Forced shots and a lack of flow have defined their offensive “attack” and it’s making them look unprepared for this methodical Wisconsin team.— ZACH HILLESLANDSeth Curry looks a lot more like Dell, but still shoots as well as his brother. He has a quick 9 points in this one, all on jumpers, and he has looked incredibly smooth doing so. I’ve often wondered how the DNA pedigree plays a role in the drafting of players. You’ve seen several sibling pairs in the N.B.A. over the years, and it seems to be increasing. I wonder if general managers are more likely to take a risk on a player because he has a proven sibling. I think the answer has to be yes. I needed a brother.— ZACH HILLESLANDGive the Albany Great Danes, with their matching mustard-yellow sneakers, a lot of credit in the early going here at Wells Fargo Center. You might have heard about Duke’s recent tournament history — does Lehigh ring a bell? — and the Blue Devils seemed determined to obliterate Albany after the opening tip by trapping in the half court and getting the ball inside to Mason Plumlee, Duke’s national player of the year candidate.But Albany has hung around — at least for four-plus minutes. A 3-pointer from Peter Hooley, one of three Australians on Albany’s roster, cut Duke’s lead to 8-5 heading into the first media timeout. Word of the day so far? Scrappy. Not certain how long this team can keep it up, though. Duke has too much size and experience.— SCOTT CACCIOLAThere needs to be a steeper penalty for flopping. The block/charge annoys me enough as it is, but when I see someone taller than six feet flopping, I want to put a sword through my television. The only thing making this O.K. is that I have yet to acquire a sword. But it’s one of my least favorite things about watching Duke and it’s how I know I would never draft certain players. If you’re a big man, don’t flop. Have some self-respect. Play defense. Stop begging for mercy.   Your ancestors are embarrassed.— ZACH HILLESLANDIs there an N.C.A.A. mandate that all low seeds have to wear ugly jerseys? Two days in a row now, I’ve had to watch little-known teams dressed as Easter eggs, and while it is putting me in the mood for candy, it is stressing my eyes and sensibilities.— ZACH HILLESLANDI love how Duke and Coach K have decided to start this game. They’re going with intense defensive pressure and overall high energy. I think that’s one of the best things you can do as a highly seeded team. I think there’s a tendency sometimes for teams to try to act too cool for school, and by doing so instill confidence in the underdogs and let them hang around. I thought that was part of Gonzaga’s problem Thursday. They were almost too polite. No. 1s aren’t supposed to be polite. They need to be mean. Duke is trying. Good for them.— ZACH HILLESLAND
